> A robust, console-based library application featuring role-based authentication, real-time financial simulation, and persistent file-based database management.

## 📖 Project Overview

The **Grand Encyclopedia** is a C++ application designed to simulate the backend and frontend operations of a digital library. Unlike simple console apps, this project implements a **custom graphical interface** using ASCII art and utilizes **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to manage complex user interactions and data persistence.

## 🏗️ System Architecture & Code Explanation

This project relies heavily on C++ OOP concepts. Below is a breakdown of how the code is structured.

### 1. Class Hierarchy (Inheritance)
The system uses **Multiple Inheritance** to separate database logic from UI logic.

* **`LibraryDB` (Backend):** The base class responsible for low-level data validation, such as checking if a Book ID exists in the file stream.
* **`libart` (Frontend):** A dedicated class in `Header.h` that stores all ASCII art, animation delays, and UI helper functions.
* **`Library` (Controller):** The main derived class. It inherits from both `LibraryDB` and `libart`, combining backend data verification with frontend visual elements.

    %% Base Database Class
    class LibraryDB {
        #check_ID_exists(string param_ID) bool
    }

    %% UI & Art Class (from Header.h)
    class libart {
        #libraryart() void
        #bookart() void
        #globeart() void
        #welcome() void
        #slowtext(string text, int delay) void
    }

    %% Main Logic Class
    class Library {
        -string loggedin_Username
        -string ID
        -string title
        -string author
        -string price
        -string type
        +Library(string t, string l)
        +MainMenu() void
        +view_book_lists() void
        +add_Books() void
        +purchase_book() void
        +deduct_user_money(double price) bool
        +enterlibrary() void
        +bookbypage(string bookId) void
        +previewbook(string bookId) void
        +preview_book() void
        +view_book_by_page() void
        +removeBook() void
        +deposit_amount() void
        +view_Balance() void
    }

    %% Authentication Class
    class Login {
        -string username
        -string password
        +string current_user_session
        +authenticate() string
        +RegularUser() bool
        +Admin() bool
        +Guest() void
        +Register() void
        +ForgotPasswordUser() void
        +ForgotPasswordAdmin() void
        +SavetoFile(string username, string password) void
        +AlreadyExists(string username) bool
        +CheckCredentailsUser(string u, string p) bool
        +CheckCredentailsAdmin(string u, string p) bool
    }

    %% Exception Handling Classes
    class FileException {
        +getMessage() string
    }

    class BookNotFoundException {
        +getMessage() string
    }

    %% Relationships
    LibraryDB <|-- Library
    libart <|-- Library
    libart <|-- Login
    Library ..> FileException : Throws
    Library ..> BookNotFoundException : Throws

```

### 2. Data Persistence (File Handling Algorithm)

Since this project does not use SQL, it implements a custom **"Read-Write-Swap"** algorithm to update records (like User Balance or Book Availability) in `.txt` files.

**The Algorithm:**

1. Open the original file (e.g., `Lists.txt`) in **Read Mode**.
2. Open a temporary file (`temp.txt`) in **Write Mode**.
3. Loop through every line of the original file:
* If the line matches the ID/Username to be updated -> **Modify the data** and write to `temp.txt`.
* If the line does not match -> **Copy the data exactly** to `temp.txt`.


4. Close both files.
5. **Remove** the original file and **Rename** `temp.txt` to the original name.

*Code Snippet (from `deduct_user_money`):*

```cpp
while (getline(readFile, tempUsername, ...) ...) {
    if (tempUsername == loggedin_Username) {
        // Calculate new balance and write updated line
        writeFile << tempUsername << "|" << tempPassword << "|" << new_amount << endl;
    } else {
        // Copy existing line
        writeFile << tempUsername << "|" << tempPassword << "|" << tempBalance << endl;
    }
}

```

### 3. Exception Handling

The project avoids standard crashes by implementing custom Exception classes defined in `Header.h`:

* **`FileException`**: Thrown when critical database files (like `Lists.txt`) are missing.
* **`BookNotFoundException`**: Thrown when an Admin tries to remove or a User tries to buy a book ID that doesn't exist.

### 4. User Interface Logic

* **Slow Text Rendering:** The `slowtext()` function uses `std::this_thread::sleep_for` and `std::chrono` to print characters one by one, simulating a retro typing effect.
* **Page-by-Page Reading:** The `bookbypage()` function intelligently parses text files by searching for specific string markers (e.g., "Page 1", "Page 2") to display only the relevant section of a book to the user.

## ✨ Application Features

### 🛡️ Role-Based Access

* **Admins:** Full control to add/remove books (`Lists.txt`).
* **Users:** Own a digital wallet. Can deposit funds and buy books. Purchasing checks availability and deducts balance automatically.
* **Guests:** Restricted to "Read-Only" mode (Preview books).

### 📖 content Delivery

* **Previews:** View the table of contents or first chapter.
* **Pagination:** Read full books page-by-page directly in the console.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

* Windows OS (Required for `system("cls")` command).
* Any C++ Compiler (MinGW, Visual Studio, etc.).
