| Thank you for purchasing this book. As the title tells you, this book is    |
| all abou t learni ng how to read people like a book in order to connect     |
| effortlessly with individuals. I can’t stress this latter part enough—I     |
| want this book to help you CONNECT with people, forge                       |
| relationships, and for the most part, strengthen your ties with others      |
| around you.                                                                 |
| My name is James and I have been studying body language and                 |
| verbal communication for a very long time. I got started after being        |
| interested in TV shows that seemed to glamorize body language and           |
| profiling. I used to suf fer from severe shyness and social anxiety , and   |
| so I thought learning how to “read people” would help me connect            |
| with them easier . As I learn ed, there is really nothing glamorous         |
| about it, the process being grounded on cold science and research.          |
| Still, I am happy to share what I know with you—especially since it         |
| helped me so much in life. Learning to read between the lines               |
| allowed me to advance in work, marry the woman of my dreams,                |
| have a good relationship with my kids, and be fulfilled in many of my       |
| social circles.                                                             |
| Knowing how to properly communicate with people is the hallmark of          |
| good relationships. These methods that you’re about to learn have           |
| given me the kind of deep relationships that I could only dream about       |
| before.                                                                     |
| So what’s the problem really ? Why do we find it so hard to connect         |
| and communicate with peop le? A good reason is because what                 |
| people say isn’t always what they mean or even what they want to            |
| say. This can lead to mixed signals, confusion, and everyo ne ending        |
| up getting something they really don’t want to get.                         |
| Let’s look at a real-world view for once. Have you ever conducted a         |
| presentation and found people dozing off or not paying attention?           |
| Have you ever had problems with your boss for reasons that you just         |
| can’t grasp? Perhaps your boss latches on quickly to suggestions            |
| made by a coworker when you suggested the exact same thing                  |
| before?                                                                     |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 9 =====                                                          |
| Or let’s look at your dating life. Do you always strike out with            |
| women? Do you find yourself unsure of what to do or what to say             |
| during a date? Do you have a hard time figuring out if a girl is also       |
| into you?                                                                   |
| These are all problems that can be solved with just the right amount        |
| of insight when it comes to body language. Body langua ge will tell         |
| you at what point your boss has lost interest or which part of the          |
| presentation is perceived as boring by your officemates. It can also        |
| tell you when a girl is interested even before you walk towards her in      |
| a bar .                                                                     |
| Knowing all these gives you the chance to assess and change                 |
| direction as needed. It can help you formulate your techniques              |
| depending on what the audience needs. Simply put, it can help you           |
| achieve goals through subtle but ef fective means.                          |
| This isn’t pseudo science either! Studies have shown that body              |
| language has a huge impact on day-to-day conversation s. A large            |
| part of human communication is done through body language. In               |
| fact, there are even classes that teach men how to alter their body         |
| language to help them attract more women. There are also classes            |
| that teach CEOs and manag ers how to become more assertive in a             |
| particular setting.                                                         |
| The good news is that you don’t have to spend thousands and go to           |
| those classes to learn techniq ues. This book can help you with those       |
| and so much more! In this book, I intend to help you figure out             |
| different perso nality types and the unique traits each one has,            |
| communicating with different personality types, how to read body            |
| language, how to understand verbal cues, and of cours e—how to              |
| train yourself to become a better “reader” of the people around you.        |
| I want you to be able to achieve bigger and better things through this      |
| book, so don’t wait around—flip over to the next page!                      |

| Chapter 1: Explanation, Quotes, Facts                                       |
| People are an endless sourc e of interest. Why they think what they         |
| think or why they do what they do has created an entire branch of           |
| science called Personality Psychology . It’s basically a branch of          |
| psychology that studies personality and how it’s different from one         |
| person to the next. It deals with the construction of a coherent            |
| picture of an individual, their psychological process, psychological        |
| differences, psychological similarities, and human nature. Simply , it      |
| tries to answer these five questions:                                       |
| ● What personality traits make up a person?                                 |
| ● How does a person think?                                                  |
| ● What makes one personality dif ferent from another?                       |
| ● What makes one personality similar with another?                          |
| ● What personality traits are already present from the moment a             |
| person is born?                                                             |
| It seems like such a simple five-question study , but it’s actually such    |
| a big field that I doubt this book will be able to discuss everything       |
| about people. However , we will try to focus our discussion on how          |
| personality affects communication with other people. More                   |
| importantly , we’re going to talk about how you can forge a                 |
| connection with different personalities through both verbal and non-        |
| verbal communication.                                                       |
| What Is Personality?                                                        |
| Personality has many definitions but for this book, we’re going to          |
| define it as a set of characteristics possessed by an individual. This      |
| set of characteristics influences a person’ s cognition , emotion,          |
| motivation, behavior , and environment. Hence, the way you behave           |
| often changes depending on who you are, where you are, and who              |
| you’re with. In fact, the word personality originated from the Latin        |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 11 =====                                                         |
| word persona , which means mask . This is why people often say              |
| they wear dif ferent masks, depending on dif ferent situations.             |
| Studies target ed towards defining, describing, and categorizing            |
| personality have been in existence for many years. In case you              |
| didn’t know , the ever-popula r Zodiac signs are actually a way of          |
| categorizing personality based on the date of your birth. Of course,        |
| since this way of categorizing personality isn’t backed by science, we      |
| won’t be talkin g about it. Instead, we shall be focusing on the ones       |
| with lots of studies behind them.                                           |
| Introvert and Extrovert                                                     |
| This is perhaps the most common classification known today . The            |
| common belief is that introverts are quiet and extroverts are loud.         |
| However , that’s actually just a manifestation of what makes each           |
| personality unique. The main difference between an extrov ert and an        |
| introvert is based on how their brains operate. That’ s right—this goes     |
| all the way to the brain and has the scientific studies to prove it.        |
| Studies show that the extrovert’ s dopamine trigger is shorter .            |
| Dopamine is the body’ s happy hormone and accordingly , stimulation         |
| for extroverts run the path of taste, touch, visual, and auditory           |
| sensory processing. It’s quick and very much felt by all five senses.       |
| This is why when extroverts gamble, the rush they get is stronger           |
| and faster . Introverts, on the other hand, run a more complicated          |
| course. The pathway area goes through planning, remembering, and            |
| solving problems.                                                           |
| What does this all mean? Well, extroverts have a brain makeup that          |
| encourages them to seek rewards while the same does not hold true           |
| for introverts.                                                             |
| Of course, this seems like such a vague explanation. So how else            |
| can we make a distinction? Perhaps a better way of explaining the           |
| difference is in terms of energy . How do introverts and extroverts         |
| gain energy and how do they recharge?                                       |
| You see, introverts recharge best alone. Being with people saps their       |
| energy and in order to bring that energy back up, they need to be           |
| alone.                                                                      |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 12 =====                                                         |
| Extroverts are the complete opposite. If they’re alone for long             |
| periods of time, it feels as though their energy is being drained.          |
| Hence, extroverts need to socialize with other people in order to           |
| recharge their energy .                                                     |
| It’s really that simple. This is why even if a person is an introvert,      |
| they can still socialize with others, participate in parties, and go to     |
| different occas ions. In the same way, some extroverts can be               |
| overcharged so that they may need some quiet alone time. Hence, I           |
| don’t want you to think that extroverts never want quiet moments or         |
| that introverts never want to be with other people. Both personalities      |
| are capable of jumping to the other side if given the chance, but their     |
| default setting means they will go back if they find the need to.           |
| This difference between the two types will tell you how you want to         |
| communicate or force a connection with a person. For example, if            |
| you’re planning a birthday party for an introvert, a small quiet event      |
| would be closer to their style. They are also more likely to appreciate     |
| gifts that they can enjoy alone, and when setting a meeting with an         |
| introvert, you would want to pick a quiet spot with little music and        |
| enough privacy for a personal conversation. On the flipside, an             |
| extrovert would appreciate a gift that encourages socialization or          |
| activities that involve great adrenaline rushes. Forging a connection       |
| with an extrovert can mean a trip to the local bar or a local festival.     |
| Later on in this book, we’ll talk more about how introverts and             |
| extroverts appreciate human connection and what makes them tick.            |
| Myers Briggs Type Indicator                                                 |
| If you do a quick search on Facebook, you’ll find dozens or even            |
| hundreds of Facebook groups dedicated towards the Myers Briggs              |
| Type Indicator , or the MBTI Personality Test. It was popu larized by       |
| Carl Jung and was once used by companies for hiring purposes.               |
| Carl Jung is the main proponent of this personality typing and was a        |
| psychoanalyst and psychiatrist who founded analytical psychology .          |
| Under the MBTI personalit y characterization, the introvert and             |
| extrovert classifications have been expanded. Instead of the                |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 13 =====                                                         |
| traditional introvert versus extrovert, personalities are now typed         |
| depending on eight dif ferent categories.                                   |
| Under the MBTI school of thought, you can either be:                        |
| ● Introverted or Extroverted                                                |
| ● Sensing or INtuitive                                                      |
| ● Thinking or Feeling                                                       |
| ● Perceiving or Judging                                                     |
| There are actually online tests for this that will tell you your            |
| personality type and will even describe what kind of person you are,        |
| how you think, how you perceive the world, and so on. In total, there       |
| are 16 Personality Types under the MBTI principle. How does this            |
| work?                                                                       |
| For example, the test shows that you’re an Introvert, an INtuitive, a       |
| Thinker , and Judging. This means that your personality type is: INTJ.      |
| You’ll notice that we’re capitalizing the letter “n” in intuitive because   |
| this helps make the distin ction between the other “I” in the               |
| personality type.                                                           |
| On the flipside, you may also be an Extrovert, an Intuitive, a Sensor ,     |
| and a Perceive r—which makes you an ENSP . You see where this is            |
| going? All possible combinations of these characteristics churn out         |
| 16 different personalities and each personality has its own unique          |
| charm and, of course, its own unique vice. What I want you to               |
| understand, however , is that ESFP is not the automatic opposite of         |
| INTJ just beca use all the letters are flipped. It’s far more complicated   |
| than that, which is why it can be tough to fully explain , but we’ll        |
| definitely try .                                                            |
| The question here is: why are there so many personality types? Carl         |
| Jung once said, “There’ s no such thing as a pure extrovert or              |
| introvert. Such a person should be in a lunatic asylum.”                    |
| This is perhaps why there has been an expansion of the classic              |
| introvert and extrovert scenario. Now we don’t just look at how you         |
| process energy but also how you process thoughts, feelings, and so          |
| on.                                                                         |
|                                                                             |

| What do the letters mean?                                                   |
| Since we already talked about the Introvert versus Extrovert                |
| situation, we won’t be describing that one in the listing. Here are         |
| what the other letters mean when it comes to MBTI:                          |
| ● Sensing – If you’re this type, this means that you become                 |
| aware of specific facts first or you prefer to focus on the precise         |
| details. This also means that you rely primarily on your five               |
| senses and use them to move forward, perceive your                          |
| surroundings, and come up with decisions.                                   |
| ● Intuitive – Denoted by the letter “N,” this means that you prefer         |
| to focus on the big picture first and plan accordingly . Intuitives         |
| also rely heavily on hunches or intuition when perceiving their             |
| surroundings.                                                               |
| ● Thinkers – This talks about the process by which you arrive at            |
| a decision. Sensing or Intuition is the way you receive the                 |
| message. Thinking or Feeling is how you process that                        |
| message. Thinkers use logical analysis to process the                       |
| message they receive.                                                       |
| ● Feeling – On the other end of the spectrum are the Feelers,               |
| who primarily use emotions. They consider the values of                     |
| everyone involved and try to hit a harmony with them.                       |
| ● Judging – Judging people are those who want their life to be              |
| planned out. You want to create a Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, or                |
| any other back up that might be necessary to achieve your                   |
| goal.                                                                       |
| ● Perceivers – These people are the ones who prefer to go with              |
| the flow. You want to keep your options open and change them                |
| accordingly .                                                               |
| Later on, we’ll talk about this some more, but from the general look        |
| of thing s, you can already tell how this personality classification can    |
| help guide you in connecting with others.                                   |
| Enneagram Personality Typing                                                |

| Under the Enneagram of Personality school of thought, there are a           |
| total of nine different personality types. All of these are                 |
| interconnected with each other and were principally derived from the        |
| teachings of a Chilean psych iatrist, Claudio Naranjo. Like the MBTI,       |
| the Enneagram was also used in business manageme nt to help                 |
| business owners gain insigh t into their employees and their fitness        |
| for specific roles. Nowada ys, it’s not considered as a huge                |
| determining factor for hiring, but some companies may still use it to       |
| guide their hiring process.                                                 |
| Here’ s a rough look at the different personality types as defined          |
| under the Enneagram System.                                                 |
| 1. The Reformer: rational, principled, purposeful, perfectionist,           |
| self-controlled, and idealistic                                             |
| 2. The Helper: caring, demonstrative, generous, possessive,                 |
| people-pleasing, and interpersonal                                          |
| 3. The Achiever: success-oriented, adaptive, excelling,                     |
| image-conscious, driven, and pragmatic                                      |
| 4. The Individualist: sensitive, expressive, dramatic,                      |
| temperamental, self-absorbed, and withdrawn                                 |
| 5. The Investigator: the cerebra l type, perceptive, secretive ,            |
| isolated, innovative, and intense                                           |
| 6. The Loyalist: committed, engaging, anxious, suspicious,                  |
| responsible, and security-oriented                                          |
| 7. The Enthusia st: busy, fun-loving, versatile, scattered ,                |
| distractible, and spontaneous                                               |
| 8. The Challenger: dominating, decisive, confrontational, self-             |
| confident, willful, and powerful                                            |
| 9. The Peacemaker: easygoing, receptive, reassuring,                        |
| complacent, agreeable, and self-ef facing                                   |
| That’ s just a basic outline of the typology . Later on, we’ll talk about   |
| this further so you’ll find out exactly how to best connect with each       |
| type.                                                                       |
|                                                                             |

| Keirsey Temperament Sorter                                                  |
| Known as the KTS, this personality typing system is slightly related        |
| to the MBTI and had a big impact in the hiring practices of some of         |
| the biggest businesses in the world. For example, at some point             |
| corporations like Coca-Cola, 7-Eleven, IBM, Bank of America, and            |
| even the US Air Force used this personality assessment technique.           |
| Under this principle, there are basically four temperaments divided         |
| into two categories and with two types each. Hence, just like the           |
| MBTI, there’ s a total of 16 types under the Keirsey system.                |
| Beautifully , these 16 personalities also correlate with the 16             |
| personalities found in the MBTI personality classification, albeit with     |
| different names.                                                            |
| Here’ s a rough outlook of these personality types:                         |
| ● Artisans – Artisans want to make an impact with an adaptable              |
| personality that makes them excellent in troubleshooting.                   |
| They’re known for their agile abilities and excellence in using             |
| instruments, tools, and equipment needed for whatever goal                  |
| they may have in mind. They often seek virtuosity and                       |
| stimulation with their greatest asset being the ability to develop          |
| tactics to meet their needs. Artisans fall into two dif ferent roles:       |
| The Entertainers – These are the informative or                             |
| reactive Artisans. This basically means that their                          |
| intelligence is catered towards improvising, allowing                       |
| them to adapt to a situation as it comes. Entertainers                      |
| are further classified into Composers and Performers.                       |
| The Operators – these are the proactive or directive                        |
| Artisans. What makes them distinctive is the unique                         |
| talent to expedite a process or basically make                              |
| activities go quicker without losing much of the goal.                      |
| They are further divided into Crafters and Promoters.                       |
| ● Guardians – These are the ones who like things scheduled                  |
| and organized. They want security and value responsibility in               |
| themselves and other people. They’re excellent at logistics and             |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 17 =====                                                         |
| make good supporters and facilitators. They branch out into two             |
| different roles:                                                            |
| The Administrators – They’re the ones who are                               |
| proactive with an intelligence developed towards                            |
| regulation. They’re further classified into Inspectors                      |
| and Supervisors.                                                            |
| The Conservators – Known as the reactive                                    |
| Guardians, they are best when put in roles of support.                      |
| Classifications of this type include Protectors and                         |
| Providers.                                                                  |
| ● Idealists – They are both compassionate and abstract. Their               |
| motivations center towards personal growth and meaning.                     |
| Because of their unique connection with themselves, they are                |
| excellent when put into roles requiring diplomacy . They have               |
| two dif ferent roles which are:                                             |
| The Mentors – These are the ones who are best in                            |
| developing roles. As the name suggests, they’re                             |
| perfect in guiding people and helping them to develop                       |
| into their full potential. Role variants are Counselors                     |
| and Teachers.                                                               |
| The Advocates – As the name suggests, this role of                          |
| the Idealist is centered towards mediation. They’re                         |
| advocates that are excellent in bridging the gap                            |
| between people. Role variants include Healers and                           |
| Champions.                                                                  |
| ● Rational – They’re the ones who are both objective and                    |
| abstract. Their main goal includes self-control and mastery of              |
| whatever they need to achieve. People who fall under this                   |
| personality type value knowledge and competence above all                   |
| else. Greatest strength is strategy and the ability to approach             |
| problems from a logical standpoint. They fall into two roles:               |
| Coordinators – Their intelligence is primarily                              |
| developed towards arranging. Role variants include                          |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 18 =====                                                         |
| Masterminds Field Marshals.                                                 |
| Engineers – Excellent at constructing, the Engineers                        |
| have the following role variants: Architects and                            |
| Inventors.                                                                  |
| Later on, we’ll talk more about these personality types and how to          |
| make connections with them.                                                 |
| The Spectrum of All Personality Types                                       |
| I can’t stress this enough—p ersonality is a spectrum. This means           |
| there’ s no set or permanent personality type. A person isn’t 100%          |
| introvert or extrovert. This is merely a “preference.” Hence , given the    |
| option, a person will display the characteristics of an introvert but if    |
| they have to, they can display extroverted characteristics as well.         |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 19 =====                                                         |
| Chapter 2: Problems and Benefits                                            |
| In this chapter , we’re first going to talk about the advan tages and       |
| pitfalls of reading body language. The fact is that body language is        |
| an inexact science and as much as it can be useful, it can also be          |
| detrimental in your social life. Here are some of the things you need       |
| to watch out for .                                                          |
| The Impact of Culture                                                       |
| One thing I want you to also consider is the impact of cultu re in body     |
| language. When trying to communicate with people, whether verbally          |
| or non-verbally , you will find that there are certain actions unique to    |
| their culture or the environment they grew up in. For example, in           |
| Asian countrie s, bowing is seen as a sign of respect while in              |
| American countries, the typical “bow” has been shortened to a               |
| simple nod of the head to someone. Also note that in Asian                  |
| countries, the depth of the bow indicates the depth of respect one          |
| might have for the other person.                                            |
| So why is this problematic? W ell, if you’re trying to communicate with     |
| someone of a different background, you will have to do your                 |
| research on their culture. What gestures are considered proper and          |
| which ones are a show of respect? While the other person may                |
| understand that you’re from a different background too and don’t            |
| know about their gestures, you will find that making that extra effort      |
| can make you stand out from the crowd.                                      |
| How Do I Know Their Personality Type?                                       |
| Now that you know the different personality types, the next problem         |
| you’ll be tackling is—how do you make the distinction?                      |
| Unfortunately , you can’t just go up to people and ask them about           |
| their personality type. In fact, many people are unlikely to know           |
| about the MBTI or the Enneagram or other personality indicator              |
| types. Unless you’re good friends with them, it’s also unlikely that        |
| you can have them answer a questionnaire to determine their                 |
| personality type.                                                           |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 20 =====                                                         |
| So what do we do then? We look at cues, behavior s, speech                  |
| patterns, and the like in order to determine an individual’ s personality   |
| type. This can be difficult and in all likelihood, you may not be 100%      |
| correct all the time, but it should be able to give you some idea on        |
| how to proceed further when communicating with another person.              |
| Here’ s some good news: you already have a clue on how body                 |
| language work s. Even as babies, it was observed that humans                |
| naturally react depending on the current mood or express ion of their       |
| nannies, mom s, dads, or any person who happens to be handling              |
| them. Chances are you can pretty much tell when someone close to            |
| you is sad, angry , frustrated, or experiencing any other emotion. As a     |
| general rule, the closer you are to a person, the easier it is for you to   |
| read their inner thoughts and emotions.                                     |
| Later on in this book, we’ll talk about how to spot dif ferent personality  |
| types by reading obvious cues and such.                                     |
| Relying Too Much on Body Language                                           |
| I also want you to note that body language is supple mental to              |
| listening. Body language will give you an insight into what a person        |
| thinks or feels inside, but you also shouldn’t ignore what they’re          |
| saying. Listen to what they’re telling you first and if you’re confused     |
| or unsure, look at their body language. This should more or less tell       |
| you about the lay of the land. Remember , there are instances when          |
| listening is better than simpl y watching a person’ s body language.        |
| The fact is that in many cases, body language is simply used to             |
| emphasize what they’re already saying, so it’s best if you listen AND       |
| look.                                                                       |
| The Power of Groups                                                         |
| Being part of a group is another obstacle when trying to read               |
| people’ s thoug hts, ideas, expressions, and body languag e. Groups         |
| tend to affect how a person approaches a particular situation,              |
| especially when put under pressure. I’m sure that at some point in          |
| your life, you managed to change your mind because of the                   |
| presence of a group. They may all be in agreement over a particular         |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 21 =====                                                         |
| course of action and so you’re forced to agree with that decision. Or       |
| perhaps you’v e made a decision in order to look good in that               |
| particular group. Conformity is the magic word when it comes to             |
| groups. Every person wants to be accepted by the commu nity and in          |
| order to do so, they have to “conform” to what the community thinks         |
| must be done. This is why it can be tough to spot an introvert during       |
| a party because some introverts conform to extrovert characteristics        |
| when thrown in the company of extroverts. In fact, a study was              |
| conducted to measure just how badly a group can affect a person’ s          |
| decision.                                                                   |
| When made to choose between what they believe to be the “right”             |
| answer and what the group thinks, 75% of people chose the group             |
| answer despite the fact that it’s the wrong one. Groups are so              |
| powerful that they can “normalize” a wrong behavior . This simply           |
| means that an action generally seen as “bad” becomes normal when            |
| allowed or repeatedly done by a group. Good examples : bullying,            |
| drinking in excess, drugs, or cigarettes. Groups also impose                |
| penalties when a person doesn’t conform to their decisions, such as         |
| throwing them out of the group and turning a person into a social           |
| pariah.                                                                     |
| How else does a group affect a person’ s thoughts, ideas, and               |
| emotions?                                                                   |
| ● Groups magnify an idea or make an opinion more powerful.                  |
| People feel confident when they join groups that validate their             |
| own opinions or thoughts. This is how labor unions, civic                   |
| unions, or charities become so powerful and widespread. Think               |
| of it as little voices joining together to become a powerful one            |
| that can be heard all over by others.                                       |
| ● Leaders also have a huge impact on how a person thinks                    |
| when that person forms part of a group. Leaders can steer                   |
| groups into the direction they want to go or convince people                |
| into agreeing to certain ideas . There’ s no better example of this         |
| than politics.                                                              |
| The Problem of Face-ism                                                     |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 22 =====                                                         |
| Face-ism is a problem that occurs often in society , although you may       |
| not realize it. It’s basically when people make judgments on a person       |
| based on their appearance. This goes beyond prejudice but rests             |
| primarily on the face of a person—specifically the shape of the face.       |
| Face-ism state s that simply based on the shape of a person’ s face,        |
| impressions might be had by individuals over the personality of an          |
| individual. For example, studies show that features with a feminine         |
| appearance are often seen as extroverted. They’re also seen as              |
| happier and more trustworthy . Does that mean that feminine features        |
| predict extroversion? No. It simply means that when you see                 |
| someone with very feminine features, you instantly label them an            |
| extrovert. But this doesn’t have to be true.                                |
| I want you to make the distinction between impressions on facial            |
| features and reading a person’ s body language. Impressions you             |
| make via facial features are stagnant or non-moving. Basically , this       |
| means that a person is not doing anything—their face is neutral. The        |
| impressions you get from their face are based purely on their blank         |
| features.                                                                   |
| When reading faces and body language, however , we’re looking at            |
| movement. People are reacting, doing, or thinking about something           |
| and therefore causing their facial expressions and body to change in        |
| relation to what they’re thinking or feeling. This movement is what we      |
| want to read here, not the blank expressions.                               |
| Physical Attractiveness                                                     |
| I hate to throw this out there , but beauty is a very strong motivator      |
| when it comes to reading body language. More than just the shape            |
| of the face or the color of the skin, having a face that matches the        |
| societal standards of beauty can really screw up a person’ s reading        |
| of body language. For example, how many times have you done                 |
| something only because a pretty girl asked you to do it? How many           |
| times have you believed that a woman is being truthful just because         |
| she has the most innocent face you’ve ever seen?                            |
| Physical attractiveness can impress upon you positive                       |
| characteristics on a person that they haven’t really lived up to. At the    |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 23 =====                                                         |
| same time, being beautiful can also make it easier for an individual        |
| to distract you from their actual motives. On the flipside, being           |
| attracted to someone can make you read deeper into superficial              |
| actions so that your interpret ation would match your personal goals.       |
| For example, just because you like a woman makes you interpret              |
| their every move as flirting when in fact, they are acting perfectly        |
| normal in the given situation.                                              |
| Your Mood Affects Your Reading                                              |
| Another problem here is that your interpretation is affected by what        |
| you think or feel at that particular moment. If you’re sad, then            |
| chances are you’ll interpret the same thing in people. This isn’t           |
| surprising since “reading” is basically you reacting to a situation, and    |
| reaction is hindered towards your overall mental and emotional              |
| health. This is why when reading people, it’s important to maintain         |
| an unbiased view of things. If you’re forced to make a decision,            |
| consider both sides of the story , taking a good look at the different      |
| people involve d, reading them, and then making your decision. It’s         |
| only smart to make readings when you’re in a calm and collected             |
| frame of mind.                                                              |
| Still, There Are Benefits                                                   |
| So you’re probably thinking, With all these problems associated with        |
| reading body language, why should I even bother? Well, there might          |
| be drawbacks, but I promise you that the benefits are just as many—         |
| perhaps even more in number . Here are some of the benefits of              |
| being able to read a person’ s expression and body language:                |
| ● You can connect better with people. This is the most important            |
| benefit we’re listing here because this is really the result you            |
| want to get when reading this book. Being able to look at a                 |
| person and instantly find out what they feel or think can help              |
| you adjust your own response in order to help them. This can                |
| be very useful in social situations, especially if you’re hosting a         |
| party and want everyone to feel included. Having an idea on                 |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 24 =====                                                         |
| what people think also lets you temper your conversation to                 |
| make sure that no one is of fended by what you said.                        |
| ● Helps with business or employment. The workplace is packed                |
| with subtle, non-verbal manners of communication, and it can                |
| be very useful to know what’ s happening under the surface. Is              |
| the client interested in your presentation or does he look                  |
| completely distracted? Take note of what pitches have a                     |
| positive reaction and which ones have a negative reaction from              |
| your boss or client. Even with your coworkers, having a good                |
| grasp on the silent communication between people makes it                   |
| easier for you to adjust depending on the demands of the                    |
| office. At the very least, being able to read these subtle cues             |
| will tell you if you’ve made an impression in the of fice.                  |
| ● Help prevent conflict. Another incredibly useful benefit of               |
| reading body language is conflict resolution. You can tell the              |
| silent signs of aggression before they actually occur , therefore           |
| allowing you to stop any negative action at just the right stage.           |
| This is useful in many situations from work, to parties, to                 |
| disagreements with your partner . Know exactly when to defuse               |
| a situation before you reach that point of no return.                       |
| ● Improve people’ s impression of you. First impression is always           |
| important, espe cially in the office setting. Knowing how to read           |
| body language doesn’t just tell you how other people think, it              |
| also tell you how you’re supp osed to act in their presence . This          |
| means that you will be able to adjust people’ s impression of               |
| you depending on a given situation. This is important if you                |
| want to create a strong presence in the office or if you want to            |
| keep things on the down low during family gatherings. Knowing               |
| when it’s time to spread out your arms or make yourself blend               |
| with the background can definitely help in achieving the effect             |
| you want to give in any situation.                                          |
| ● Become a better communicator . Of course, if you’re in the                |
| position to receive and interpret verbal and non-v erbal                    |
| communication, this puts you in the perfect place to respond to             |
| these same messages. Don’t forget—communication is a two-                   |
| way street and in order to send a message in the right context,             |
|                                                                             |

| you have to be able to receive a message in the right context.              |
| Doing both correctly guarant ees that the flow of information is            |
| stable, quick, and accurate.                                                |

| Chapter 3: Introverts – Identify, Communicate,                              |
| and Personality Type Motivations                                            |
| This chapter is going to delve deeper into personality types and how        |
| to make connections with people depending on their perceived                |
| personality types. I want to stress the use of the word “perceive”          |
| here because unless you’ve made them take a test to figure out their        |
| personality type, chances are you’re going to be guessing what              |
| category they fall into. This is why this chapter also helps you with       |
| that particular problem.                                                    |
| This chapter deals with personality types in three ways.                    |
| The first one answers the question: What are the characteristics of a       |
| specific personality type? The second one answers the question:             |
| How do you communicate and connect with a specific personality              |
| type? This one will help you tailor your communication style to             |
| connect with this particular person. Remember , the whole goal of this      |
| book is to help you forge better relations with people.                     |
| And finally, the third one answers the question: What is the typical        |
| motivation of this personalit y type? This is crucial because every         |
| person has a different motivation. Different personality types often        |
| have end-games or purposes when interacting with people. You will           |
| find that these different motivations can help you better figure out        |
| what they ultimately want in a given situation.                             |
| In this chapter and the next one, we’re going to answer the question:       |
| How do you identify an introv ert or extrovert? As mentioned, people        |
| can be very good in hiding their actual personality preferences.            |
| Hence, an introvert may not always be sitting in the corner of the          |
| room, they may be in the center of action and simply doing their best       |
| extroverted act. Here are some signs that can help you identify these       |
| personality preferences and how to interact with them.                      |
| Just a little preface before talking about spotting and comm unicating.     |
| I want you to take a good look at the classifications we’ve made in         |
| the previous chapter . This time, we won’t stop at just the introvert       |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 27 =====                                                         |
| and the extrovert. Instead, we’re going to go a little bit further and      |
| talk about the different MBTI personalities and how you’re supposed         |
| to communicate with them after you’ve made identification. I want           |
| you to understand that it’s not always easy to make a classification,       |
| especially if you’re doing it for the first time. Some characteristics are  |
| completely internal, which means that you won’t be able to quickly          |
| see it in the person’ s words and actions. Still, we’re going to try our    |
| best to give you the best chance of connecting with people.                 |
| Signs of an Introvert                                                       |
| ● Zoning out – In social situations, introverts are likely to zone          |
| out during conversations or in the middle of all the parties. They          |
| can easily become quiet during conversations, as if they’ve                 |
| mentally left the place. Don’t worry , they’ll come back sooner or          |
| later, often asking question s to help them catch up to the                 |
| conversation.                                                               |
| ● They’re the ones who leave early . This doesn’t happen just               |
| once but all the time during parties or any other social situation.         |
| ● Introverts are also the ones who tend to “disappear” during               |
| parties. They’re the ones who gravitate towards the quieter part            |
| of the house, often grouping up with other introverts and just              |
| talking quietly in a private space. Often, introverts stick close to        |
| the people they already know .                                              |
| ● They’re the ones who have an intense interest in books, the               |
| arts, or even the animals in the room. This kind of interest often          |
| allows them to be alone while still appearing as if they’re                 |
| enjoying themselves at the party .                                          |
| ● They can be quite irritable if you’re together for long periods of        |
| time. This is because introverts often need “down time” after               |
| socializing for quite some time.                                            |
| ● They’re also the ones who are happy to lend a helping hand                |
| when it comes to activities that let them be alone. Hence, they             |
| can volunteer to serve the DJ, clean up the house, take food to             |
| someone, or even take photo graphs. This lets them stay clear               |
| from all the activities while still being part of the actual party .        |
|                                                                             |

| Introvert Types According to the MBTI                                       |
| INFJ – Introvert, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging                               |
| INFJs are big users of metaphors and symbols during conversations.          |
| They like to talk about insights, visions, and predictions , all while      |
| being emphatic and warm in their conversations. Being introverts,           |
| their conversat ional skills are best displayed in small circles or one-    |
| on-one interactions.                                                        |
| Here are the typical characteristics of the INFJ:                           |
| ● They talk using symbols and metaphors to really convey what               |
| they’re trying to say. Their preferred topics of conversation               |
| revolve aroun d visions of the future, predictions, and                     |
| possibilities.                                                              |
| ● They like to show solidarity with others by saying words like “I          |
| understand” when in conversations. Well-mannered, INFJ’ s are               |
| tactful and very adaptable. In fact, they can switch back and               |
| forth in social events, mana ging to establish rapport all the              |
| while.                                                                      |
| ● INFJs are introverted intuitive, which means that their process           |
| is most ly internal. This is why they like metaphors and symbols            |
| in conversations. When it comes to topics they’re passionate                |
| about, they can be tough to understand. In fact, when it comes              |
| to certain topics, it appears as though they’re only rambling               |
| when in truth, they’re trying to process an idea.                           |
| ● When confronted by a debate or an argument, the INFJs are                 |
| the ones who prefer to take on the role of peacemakers.                     |
| ● These personality types tend to flock to the following careers:           |
| missionaries, clergy , counselors, medical doctors,                         |
| chiropractors, psychiatrists, writers, photographers, dentists,             |
| social workers, librarians, and education consultants.                      |
| INTJ – Introvert, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging                              |
| INTJs are considered to be one of the rarest types in the MBTI              |
| scheme. This is why when you do finally meet one, there’ s a good           |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 29 =====                                                         |
| chance that you will have a hard time understanding their                   |
| personality . Here are the typical characteristics of an INTJ:              |
| ● INTJs are quiet and prefer to spend the day by themselv es.               |
| When they do start talking, however , they prefer to focus on               |
| future events and enjoy discussing the many implications or                 |
| meanings of events, topics, or situations.                                  |
| ● They tend to speak using lots of symbols or metaphors to                  |
| describe things. They’re the ones who often say phrases like:               |
| “If this happened, then that means that…” as they like to                   |
| establish connections between events in a logical but futuristic            |
| manner .                                                                    |
| ● They love to strategize and often focus on creating long-term             |
| solutions to problems. Because they’re intuitive instead of being           |
| sensors, it can be difficult for them to explain their thoughts and         |
| ideas to people, so be patient.                                             |
| ● Don’t be surprised if you get lost when talking to an INTJ.               |
| They tend to go straight from point A to point D, skipping                  |
| several letters along the way. Combined with their love for                 |
| metaphors it can be very confusing, especially if you’re talking            |
| to one for the first time.                                                  |
| ● They stick to logical and analytical modes of thinking. They              |
| can also be very direct to the point of being rude. Like other              |
| NTs, they like to process information quietly so that when they             |
| finally say something, they sound very sure of their conclusion.            |
| ● Common careers include professors, teachers, medica l                     |
| doctors, corporate strategists, engineers, computer                         |
| programmers, photographers, managers, military , and research               |
| department managers.                                                        |
| ISTJ – Introvert, Sensing, Thinking, Judging                                |
| They like to think before they speak, which seems true for all              |
| introvert types. You will notice how their body language shows              |
| they’re mulling over a question or comment before they even                 |
| respond. These are the kind of people who will take a long time             |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 30 =====                                                         |
| composing a comment through Facebook and will review their                  |
| message before eventually hitting send. Here are some of the                |
| characteristics of this type:                                               |
| They’re the types who like to keep things as linear as                      |
| possible. This means that during speeches or meetings,                      |
| they’re the types who recap conversations. They will repeat                 |
| what another person said and then tack their comment at                     |
| the end, just to make sure everyone is on the same page.                    |
| They also like to connect current situations with past ones                 |
| in order to make a correlation or to keep it factual. They’ d               |
| say words like “it looks like” or “it’s the same as” or                     |
| “remember when” to keep the conversation grounded and                       |
| make sure everyone can see the similarity or difference to                  |
| a current situation. Typically , this is done to add some                   |
| authority to their conclusions or ideas.                                    |
| When talking, they tend to focus on facts and rarely                        |
| exaggerate what they’re trying to say. This also means that                 |
| their movemen ts tend to be limited as they focus on the                    |
| context of what they’re trying to say. Note that these types                |
| are not big on facial expressions or body language so you                   |
| might have a harder time reading them.                                      |
| They don’t like being the center of attention when in fact,                 |
| they actually have an air of mystery on them that draws in                  |
| people.                                                                     |
| Feelings and emotions are kept close and private by the                     |
| ISTJ so don’t expect great shows of affection from them .                   |
| They’re not good with surprises, especially if they’r e                     |
| socially accepted to respond with lots of emotions. These                   |
| feelings are often reserved to really close people in their                 |
| lives.                                                                      |
| These personality types are typically found in profession s                 |
| of business, administrators, dentists, programmers,                         |
| lawyers, judge s, accountants, detectives, math teachers ,                  |
| engineers, and technicians.                                                 |
| ISTP – Introvert, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving                             |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 31 =====                                                         |
| ISTPs prefer to process their thoughts internally . You’re not going to     |
| hear them reciting their analysis out loud but instead keeping it           |
| secret and intact before talking. As a result, their words would be         |
| factual, direct, and concise because they choose only to speak them         |
| out loud when they’re alread y fully formed. Here’ s how to spot one        |
| out in the wild:                                                            |
| ● They’re the types who are likely to pause in the middle of a              |
| sentence in order to find the perfect word for what they’re trying          |
| to say. Their vocabulary and phrasing is very precise as they               |
| want to keep things quick and simple.                                       |
| ● They’re the ones who seem like they’re very opinionated. This             |
| is because of their factual approach to any problem as well as              |
| the precision of their logic. Everything has been cross-checked             |
| before entering into any kind of debate or discussion. They’re              |
| not afraid to raise issues if they see any, especially since their          |
| detailed senso ry data managed to go through the logica l pros              |
| and cons of a specific pathway .                                            |
| ● Because of their love for the logical and the concise, they’re            |
| not very good with feelings or emotions. ISTPs will feel very out           |
| of place and ill at ease if asked to talk about their feelings. If          |
| pushed or in a very stressful situation however , you might find            |
| that ISTPs suddenly become overly emotional even if it is out of            |
| their character .                                                           |
| ● ISTP personality types tend to gravitate to careers like                  |
| forensic pathol ogists, system analysts, computer program mers,             |
| firefighters, paramedics, electrical engineers, pilots, and                 |
| transportation operatives.                                                  |
| Communicating with INFJs, INTJs, ISTJs, and ISTPs                           |
| When communicating with any person in this particular group, you            |
| want to remember that they’re strong introverts. This means that            |
| their ability to maintain social communication is shorter—they often        |
| prefer their interactions to be quick and straight to the point. Here are   |
| some of the things you have to remember when communi cating with            |
| any of these types:                                                         |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 32 =====                                                         |
| ● Don’t ramble, they hate that. If you want to communicate                  |
| specific information, tell it to them straight.                             |
| ● Do not use small talk if you want to get information from them.           |
| Ask about it straight out and you will get a straight answer from           |
| them.                                                                       |
| ● They may enjoy banter , but if they’re working on a particu lar           |
| project, it’s important to stay away and just allow them to focus.          |
| ● Learn to listen because these types put a lot of stock into               |
| listening. Remember that their main goal is information so if               |
| someone is talking, they will make every effort to listen. Hence,           |
| they expect the same courtesy from others and hate it when                  |
| people interrupt them in the middle of a sentence.                          |
| ● Give them time to think about their answer before voicing it out          |
| loud.                                                                       |
| ● Greet them with a smile, but don’t expect to stand there and              |
| exchange pleasantries. They’re not really fond of that. Instead,            |
| greet them but give them their personal space. No hugs or any               |
| kind of air kisses unless you’re very close or you’re a family              |
| member .                                                                    |
| ● Eye contact every now and then is okay simply to affirm                   |
| connection.                                                                 |
| ● Note that when on a project, they tend to be very focused. Any            |
| sort of distract ion or effort to prevent them from finishing their         |
| goal will likely be dealt with negatively . Conversations of any            |
| sort will be shrugged of f as it only throws them of f their focus.         |
| ● Do not rush them. As with other introverts, INTPs like to enjoy           |
| their time working on a project. They’re careful and particular             |
| about their goals and believe that distractions can lower the               |
| precision of their executions.                                              |
| ● When working with this type, it helps to always update them of            |
| what’ s going on. They want to find out at what stage you are in            |
| your job and not only when it’ s finished. This helps them assess           |
| the situation and adjust accordingly .                                      |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 33 =====                                                         |
| ● Note that these types can go quickly from friendly to dista nt.           |
| They have a short social fuse which means that after some                   |
| time socializing with others, they’re going to need some alone              |
| time to recharge. True introverts, their social fuse tends to be            |
| shorter than most, unless they’ve managed to train themselves               |
| into it.                                                                    |
| ● During tense situations or when stressed, INTPs draw into                 |
| themselves. They become quiet and stoic, unlike other types                 |
| which tend to burst out or let everyone know what they’re                   |
| feeling.                                                                    |
| INFP – Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Perceiving                          |
| Having a strong sense of personal values, INFPs are emphatic and            |
| imaginative. Their creative streak makes them very adept in                 |
| discussing theoretical poss ibilities. Their favorite topics usually        |
| include how to help animals, how to help people, or even how to help        |
| the world completely . Here are typical characteristics of this             |
| personality type:                                                           |
| They have strong values but they’re not the preachy type.                   |
| They will keep their though ts and beliefs close to heart                   |
| unless specifically asked about them. They’re the kind of                   |
| people who let others live their lives and don’t interfer e                 |
| unless they think they’re in the position to make changes.                  |
| Usually , this privilege is extended only to friends and                    |
| relatives.                                                                  |
| Because of their belief in allowing people to express their                 |
| individuality , INFPs are not very good in conversations                    |
| when people try to impose their thoughts and ideas on                       |
| others. They will have an internal cringe or at worst, they                 |
| might even confront another about it.                                       |
| Gentle and modest, they’re often shy and prefer one-to-                     |
| one conversations. At parties, they’re going to be the ones                 |
| who gravitate to the people they already know and spen d                    |
| most of the time in a quieter area of the house.                            |
|                                                                             |

| You will often find them thriving in careers as writers ,                   |
| counselors, childcare workers, missionaries, psychiatrists,                 |
| scientists, psychologists, education consultants, journalists,              |
| and social scientists.                                                      |
| INTP – Introvert, Intuitive, Thinking, Perceiving                           |
| INTPs are pretty rare in the wild and have a very quiet personality .       |
| All their thought processes are done internally , which means that          |
| they’ll only speak out their opinions after having an internal              |
| monologue in their head. Here are some signs of an INTP:                    |
| They’re very precise with words. They don’t just think about                |
| the implications but also how to word their thoughts in a                   |
| way that keeps it brief and concise. This means that they                   |
| take a long time to respond because they’re looking for the                 |
| perfect words to convey their meaning.                                      |
| They keep things logical and rarely venture toward s                        |
| emotions and feelings. In fact, they like to keep things on                 |
| the topic at hand and don’t like veering of f into tangents.                |
| They’re the kinds who categorize information into smalle r                  |
| pieces. This means that they will group information based                   |
| on specific characteristics. This allows them to bette r                    |
| remember information and create connections betwee n                        |
| different subjects.                                                         |
| Because of their preference for categorization and                          |
| connecting information with each other , it takes a fairly long             |
| time for INTPs to arrive at a conclusion. Once the planning                 |
| is over, however , they will execute their plan to perfection               |
| and will not veer away from it.                                             |
| Give INTPs sufficient time to think about answers to                        |
| questions. They don’t like being pressured, especially                      |
| when coming to a conclusion.                                                |
| They’re outside-the-box thinkers so don’t be surprised if                   |
| they sometime s put forward an idea that’s out of this world.               |
| Be assured, however , that they thought about it first before               |
| voicing it.                                                                 |
|                                                                             |

| INTPs are not very good when it comes to expressing                         |
| feelings and emotions so unless you absolutely have to, try                 |
| not to dwell too much about it during conversations.                        |
| Common careers include chemists, photographers,                             |
| biologists, mathematicians, computer programmers,                           |
| university professors, forensic researchers, psychologists,                 |
| artists, and social scientists.                                             |
| ISFJ – Introvert, Sensing, Feeling, Judging                                 |
| They’re a lot like ISTJs in that they think long and hard before            |
| talking. Do not rush them as they want to delve into every possibility      |
| before deciding on a course of action. Here are the typical                 |
| characteristics of the ISFJ:                                                |
| ISFJs like to keep a timeline in their head, which reflects                 |
| when they speak. When trying to prove a point or                            |
| conveying information, they will make use of past                           |
| experiences of information to make their argument more                      |
| believable.                                                                 |
| When talking, they often use words such as “like” or                        |
| “reminds me of” or “remember when.”                                         |
| Unlike other introverts, ISFJs are actually very good in                    |
| relaying empathy . This is their way of connecting with                     |
| people or showing solidarity .                                              |
| They have a constantly profe ssional and polite demeano r.                  |
| They’re actual ly quite responsive but prefer one-on-on e                   |
| interactions over groups. Hence, these are the same                         |
| people who will be looking for familiar faces in a party and                |
| spending most of their time in a quiet corner of the room.                  |
| They’re not very good with criticism and will often feel                    |
| uncomfortable if made the subject of any. They can take                     |
| these criticisms personally and will not do well in                         |
| arguments or debates, even a friendly one. Hence, they’re                   |
| the type to think about past blunders over and over in their                |
| head.                                                                       |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 36 =====                                                         |
| Note that long-range forecasting is not their forte. Unlike                 |
| NT types who have no problem predicting possibilities,                      |
| ISFJs like to keep their future predictions within safe short-              |
| term levels. However , their predictions are often good and                 |
| well thought of.                                                            |
| Common careers for this type include childcare,                             |
| administrators, career counselors, clerical supervisors,                    |
| police of ficers, church workers, and doctors.                              |
| ISFP - Introverted, Sensing, Feeling, and Perceiving                        |
| The open-mind ed introverts who can be emphatic and easygoing if            |
| they feel like it, ISFPs can blend in with the extroverts—but not too       |
| much. They have strong values but don’t really want to show it on           |
| the surface unless they’re in the company of someone they really            |
| trust. These are the kinds of people who respect the differences            |
| between peop le and will therefore not tell other people what they          |
| should or should not do. Sure , ISFPs may have a fairly good idea of        |
| what your next move should be, but they’re not the types to give            |
| unsolicited advice. If you try to challenge their values, however , the     |
| ISFP will definitely fight with you in a tone of voice that is far from     |
| their usual character .                                                     |
| Some characteristics of the ISFP are:                                       |
| ● They’re quiet and honest with everyone they meet. During                  |
| conversations, they’re the ones who like to listen and seldom               |
| draw attention to their person. In fact, if they suddenly find              |
| themselves the center of attention, an ISFP will grow quiet.                |
| ● Believe it or not, ISFPs love adventure. They’re the ones who             |
| enjoy going to concerts or vacations and will happily talk about            |
| them if given the chance. They also delve deeply into projects              |
| and can be quite impulsive as they always want to add to their              |
| collection of memorable experiences.                                        |
| ● They’re not really happy being in conflict-packed                         |
| environments. They will actively put effort into avoiding these             |
| situations or making sure that they’re not part of the conflict.            |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 37 =====                                                         |
| ● ISFPs tend to be attracted to careers in music, art, childcare,           |
| social work, teaching, animal care, medicine, bookkeeping , and             |
| physical therapy .                                                          |
| Communicating with INFPs, INTPs, ISFJs, and ISFPs                           |
| Communicating with these four types are more or less the same.              |
| Here are some tips when approaching or connecting with any of               |
| these types:                                                                |
| Keep your greetings quiet and friendly . Try not to overloa d               |
| them with af fection or be very public with your greetings.                 |
| Take note that they have a fairly weird sense of humo r.                    |
| Their ability to distinguis h between what’ s sociall y                     |
| acceptable and what’ s not is a little vague so try not to take             |
| them too seriously or too personally .                                      |
| Don’t rush things with them. Never interrupt; allow these                   |
| types to fully say what they want to say before responding .                |
| Perhaps one of their biggest pet peeves is being                            |
| interrupted while in the middle of a sentence. Give nods                    |
| every now and then to let them know you’re following the                    |
| conversation.                                                               |
| When push comes to shove, these personality types can                       |
| become quite critical.                                                      |
| Quality is more important than speed so be prepared to                      |
| revise and rework your output several times before you’ll                   |
| get their approval.                                                         |
| Public recognition and compliments can be quite                             |
| embarrassing and very uncomfortable for these types.                        |
|                                                                             |

| Chapter 4: Extroverts – Identify, Communicate,                              |
| and Personality Type Motivations                                            |
| This chapter is going to delve deeper into personality types and how        |
| to make connections with people depending on their perceived                |
| personality types of “extroverts.” I want to stress the use of the word     |
| “perceive” here because unless you’ve made them take a test to              |
| figure out their personality type, chances are you’re going to be           |
| guessing what category they fall into. This chapter also helps you          |
| with that particular problem.                                               |
| Just to recap, this chapter deals with personality types in three ways.     |
| The first one answers the question: What are the characteristics of a       |
| specific personality type? This will help you make identification,          |
| although I have to be hones t, chances are your analysis won’t be           |
| 100% correct all the time. Practice will help improve your skills on        |
| this front.                                                                 |
| The second one answers the question: How do you communicate                 |
| and connect with a specific personality type? This one will help you        |
| tailor your communication style to connect with this particular person.     |
| Remember , the whole goal of this book is to help you forge better          |
| relations with people.                                                      |
| And finally, the third one answers the question: What is the typical        |
| motivation of this personalit y type? This is crucial because every         |
| person has a different motivation. Different personality types often        |
| have end-games or purposes when interacting with people. You will           |
| find that these different motivations can help you better figure out        |
| what they ultimately want in a given situation.                             |
| Signs of an Extrovert                                                       |
| One thing I want you to remember is that extroversion is not a “bad”        |
| thing. There seems to be a current trend nowadays where introverts          |
| are viewed as the nice, sweet, unassuming people while extroverts           |
| are the gregarious ones who are flighty and talk too much. Note             |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 39 =====                                                         |
| though that this isn’t always the case. There is no “better” type and       |
| both introverts and extroverts have their own strengths and                 |
| weaknesses.                                                                 |
| Here are some of the typical distinguishing marks of an extrovert:          |
| They have broad and numerous interests, usually the types                   |
| that encourage socializing and being with other people .                    |
| Surfing, biking, and team games are some of the activities                  |
| they usually enjoy .                                                        |
| They communicate best through conversations. In fact,                       |
| they’re very enthusiastic when talking, often adding punc h                 |
| to their argument through hand gestures. They’re also                       |
| comfortable being touchy-feely in public. Hence, they’re the                |
| types who will air kiss with friends, give people a slap on                 |
| the back, and give shoulder hugs when they’re happy .                       |
| They have no problem being the center of attention. In fact,                |
| they can quickly lighten up when the attention is pulle d                   |
| towards them.                                                               |
| They’re happy with group work and can seamlessly blend                      |
| with any group.                                                             |
| They like going out on a routine basis. They’re the ones                    |
| who may have a routine when it comes to nights out or                       |
| drinks after dinner or work.                                                |
| Of course, they also like to talk about their thoughts and                  |
| feelings out loud. They will have no problem seeking out                    |
| inspiration and advice from people they believe are                         |
| capable of providing help.                                                  |
| Extrovert Types According to the MBTI                                       |
| ENFP – Extrovert, Intuitive, Feeling, Perceiving                            |
| ENFPs are very lively and jump into conversations with an                   |
| unmistakable zest for connec ting with people. This liveliness is very      |
| contagious and can draw in people, especially during brainstorming          |
| sessions. Here are the typical characteristics of an ENFP:                  |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 40 =====                                                         |
| They love to focus towards personal growth and will                         |
| happily jump into conversations that involve this kind of                   |
| topic. Their values are focused towards improvement for                     |
| themselves, other people, and the world.                                    |
| This need for growth and improvement actually makes                         |
| many ENFPs rebels. This means that instead of going                         |
| through the tried and tested road, they prefer to forge their               |
| own paths. They have no problem questioning the typical                     |
| societal rules and if it doesn ’t work for them, then they’ ll              |
| choose to do something else.                                                |
| ● These creative types gravitate towards careers that allow                 |
| them to be writers, painters, musicians, journa lists,                      |
| psychologists, teachers, politicians, television reports, and               |
| social workers.                                                             |
| ENTP – Extrovert, Intuitive, Thinking, Perceiving                           |
| Creative and energetic, these personality types like to make good           |
| use of logic when they communicate with others. They like to                |
| brainstorm and thrown ideas out in the open to get everyone in on           |
| the thinking game. Discussio ns invigorate them and help them move          |
| on to further possibilities. Note though that when conversing, they         |
| often focus on the general side of things and leave the nitty-gritty        |
| details to others. Here are some of the characteristics of an ENTP:         |
| They have the ability to form connections in their mind                     |
| instantly and are not afraid to voice it. The problem here is               |
| that most people don’t instantly see the connection so                      |
| there’ s a chance that they’ll be looked at weirdly by others               |
| at first.                                                                   |
| Quite logical when it comes to making decisions or arriving                 |
| at assessments, these personality types love to analyze                     |
| things and keep subjects categorized according to their                     |
| personal preferences. They essentially want to put                          |
| everything in its place in the grand scheme of things.                      |
|                                                                             |

| They love tracing connections between different parts of                    |
| life, from the theoretical to the realistic. They’re the ones               |
| who will tell you about cool facts and about how seemingl y                 |
| small inconsequential things have a big impact in the                       |
| world. They’re big fans of what is known as the butterfly                   |
| effect.                                                                     |
| They have no problem participating in debates but tend to                   |
| pause during conversations in order to contemplat e                         |
| specific topics.                                                            |
| These types are great in conversations as they are willing                  |
| to change their opinion if given sufficient information to                  |
| make an impact. They’re not afraid to burst out with their                  |
| doubts, but keep in mind that any arguments they may                        |
| have are just their way of figuring out the truth.                          |
| These persona lity types aren’t really fans of small talk and               |
| nitty-gritty details. They like to maintain their focus on the              |
| big picture and maintain their thoughts on bigger goals.                    |
| You will often find these people in careers like lawyers ,                  |
| photographers, psychologists, consultants, actors,                          |
| engineers, marketers, computer programmers, writers,                        |
| artists, and psychiatrists.                                                 |
| ESFJ – Extrovert, Sensing, Feeling, Judging                                 |
| Despite the similarities in many of the letters, the ESTJ and the           |
| ESFJ are wildly different. They’re both extroverts so they have no          |
| problem being part of parties or showing up in events. Here’ s what         |
| you have to know about the ESFJ:                                            |
| ● They like to use the words “we” and “us” a lot because this               |
| helps them establish a connection with people. Basically , they’d           |
| always want to create a sens e of inclusion and make sure that              |
| everyone is in perfect harmony with each other . It’s not                   |
| surprising to find them as the ones who prefer to be politically            |
| correct in everything they do.                                              |
| ● They want people to feel comfortable to the point where they              |
| would even make fun of themselves just to put someone at                    |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 42 =====                                                         |
| ease. This self-deprecating humor makes them likeable in large              |
| groups. Matched with their conscious efforts not to offend                  |
| anyone and you should be able to get a generally likeable                   |
| person.                                                                     |
| ● They want to relate to other people, so these are the kinds of            |
| people who will share similar experiences with you. They’d tell             |
| you they can relate or understand experiences you might have                |
| and make you feel included. They don’t like conflict and will try           |
| to stop debates or arguments.                                               |
| ● They’re very good in picking up emotional tension and will try            |
| their best to diffuse the situation. The problem here is that even          |
| friendly debates are viewed as conflicts by these types, which              |
| is why even these lively conversations are actively stopped by              |
| them if possible.                                                           |
| ● They’re very conscious about socializing within boundari es.              |
| Sure, they have no problem being at parties, but they’re likely             |
| to leave at a time they deem appropriate. They don’t want to                |
| overstay their welcome and are therefore deeply conscious of                |
| the right amount of time to stay during social events.                      |
| ● They’re sensors, which mean that they are fully aware of the              |
| concrete needs of people. They’re the ones who will notice if               |
| someone needs water or if someone hasn’t eaten yet. They like               |
| to give solid solutions to solid problems, so don’t’ expect too             |
| many feelings from them.                                                    |
| ● These personality types typically have the following caree rs:            |
| nursing, childcare, physicians, office managers, social workers,            |
| bookkeeping, clergy , home economics, receptionists,                        |
| pathologists, and religious educators.                                      |
| So how do you connect with an ESFJ? Here are some things to                 |
| remember:                                                                   |
| ● Be focused with the task – An ESFJ will respect you for that.             |
| You need to be encouraging without losing sight of the ultimate             |
| goal. Greet people, be warm, encouraging, and open—but                      |
| when it’ s time to work, focus on the work.                                 |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 43 =====                                                         |
| ● Offer concrete evidence when making presentations. They                   |
| want cold, hard facts instead of presumptions or predictions                |
| that have no basis. Always use hard data and don’t be afraid to             |
| cite your resources for that data. Make sure it’s accurate and              |
| precise, as vague information is something ESFJs hate.                      |
| ● They also want practical applications to problems. Simply put,            |
| your input should be actionable or something that can be done,              |
| measured, and observed. It doesn’t matter if its long term or               |
| short term; ESFJs have no problem with waiting for the results              |
| they want. As long as the actions leading to those results are              |
| something they have practical control over .                                |
| ● Be transparent when talking to an ESFJ about objectives and               |
| the plan on how to get to them. If you have an ESFJ working                 |
| under you, it’s important to explain to them not just the end goal          |
| but also the steps you want to take in order to arrive at that end          |
| goal. They need to see how these actions have a practica l link             |
| to the end result.                                                          |
| ● They like the status quo, especially if it’s an office policy that        |
| has been proven to work before. Hence, if you’re pushing new                |
| things to them , it’s important to explain exactly why the shift is         |
| happening. They’re not unreasonable. ESFJs have no problem                  |
| welcoming something different as long as they can see the                   |
| logical link between the new thing and the ultimate goal.                   |
| ESFP – Extrovert, Sensing, Feeling, Perceiving                              |
| Warm and caring and very enthusiastic, ESFPs are packed with                |
| energy and have the chari sma to match. They often bring that               |
| unidentifiable “buzz” into a room that makes it very difficult to resist    |
| them when they’re set to make an impression. Here are some of the           |
| typical characteristics of the ESFP:                                        |
| ● They love making lots of physical gestures so keep your eye               |
| out for the person who is expressive with their hands. They                 |
| have a very upbeat tone that engages everyone to be part of                 |
| the conversation.                                                           |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 44 =====                                                         |
| ● They’re the kind of people who like to focus on the present               |
| because the future is prone to change. They make excellent                  |
| storytellers and love dwelling in reality . They’re very literal and if     |
| you engage them in theoretical discussions, they’re bound to                |
| get bored quickly .                                                         |
| ● They don’t like being rushed, especially when it comes to                 |
| making decisions.                                                           |
| ● ESFPs are also very good in identifying the different                     |
| mannerisms of people. They can quickly tell if a person is                  |
| getting bored and can therefore make their company more                     |
| interesting for that person.                                                |
| ● ESFPs typically gravitate to careers as painters, actors ,                |
| comedians, teachers, counselors, childcare, interior design,                |
| fashion, managers, human resources, photography , coaches,                  |
| and clerical supervisors. Their amazing enthusiasm makes                    |
| them great motivators in any activity they choose to invest in.             |
| Communicating with the ENFPs, ENTPs, ESFJs, and ESFPs                       |
| Since they’re all extroverts, communicating with these personality          |
| types are more or less the same. Here are basic tips on how to forge        |
| connections with people in this category:                                   |
| ● Always smile and make eye contact when you greet them in                  |
| the morning, or during whatever time you might see them.                    |
| They’re extroverts—they’re happy to make that initial                       |
| connection with you.                                                        |
| ● Keep the energetic vibe up with gestures that are open and                |
| encompassing. Use your hands and arms, allowing for vibrant                 |
| and obvious movements that encourage participation.                         |
| ● Be responsive to questions asked and if you’re the one asking             |
| the questions, keep them open-ended. Allow these personality                |
| types to expand on their answers or give them the chan ce to                |
| elaborate on the topic.                                                     |
| ● They’re the types who think out loud so let them rant out their           |
| thoughts befor e pitching in. This isn’t them saying nothing out            |
| to thin air , it’s actually their thought process.                          |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 45 =====                                                         |
| ● If you want to communicate information to them, then the best             |
| way to do that is to give personal examples or use stories. This            |
| will get their attention and make a better impact instead of just           |
| stating possibilities in a detached manner .                                |
| ● Allow them to explore different options before arriving at a              |
| decision. Try not to pressure them into arriving at a conclusion            |
| as this will only irritate them and lower the quality of their              |
| answer . Since they like to think out loud, allow them to rant it           |
| out before asking what their “final” thoughts on the matter                 |
| would be. Do not assume the first thing they said is their                  |
| answer because chances are they’re just going through the                   |
| instances in their head.                                                    |
| ● If you want them to do some thing or are trying to convin ce              |
| them to be part of something, try pointing out something that               |
| you think would be fun or entertaining for them to do.                      |
| ● There will be some debate and arguments when you’re                       |
| interacting with these personality types. Don’t take it personally          |
| as this is their way of having fun.                                         |
| ● When trying to explain something to them, allow for more time             |
| when it comes to questions and conversations. Present the                   |
| main points and let them ponder the information for as long as              |
| possible.                                                                   |
| ● Note that people with this kind of personality type tend to use           |
| humor during tense moments . This is their way of breaking the              |
| tense atmosphere.                                                           |
| Take note that when angry or stressed, these personality types tend         |
| to beco me louder, more expressive, and heavily animat ed. It may           |
| seem complete ly out of context, but this is how they handle typical        |
| stressful situations.                                                       |
| ESTJ – Extrovert, Sensing, Thinking, Judging                                |
| An ESTJ is an out-loud thinker , which makes sense because they’re          |
| extroverted thinkers. They’re the ones who speak out facts and              |
| make out-loud judgments, making it seem as though they’re stating           |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 46 =====                                                         |
| the obvious, but really , they’re just saying these ideas out loud to       |
| make them more concrete. Hence, if you want to conne ct with an             |
| ESTJ, don’t throw out “duh” or “obviously” reactions to them because        |
| this is exactly how their thought process works. In fact, you’ll find that  |
| even when alone, an ESTJ will talk to themselves in order to                |
| properly process their thoughts before arriving at a conclusion.            |
| Here are other typical characteristics of the ESTJ:                         |
| ● They’re confident when speaking and like to stick to factual              |
| and realistic topics. They’re the ones who can easily remember              |
| facts and are more likely to compare past and present                       |
| situations before moving forward with anything.                             |
| ● In some instances, the ESTJ can appear quite tactless as they             |
| don’t like to sugarcoat things for the sake of peace. They will try         |
| to tone down their words, but it would still be slightly edged              |
| compared to those who are used to social situations.                        |
| ● They’re the ones who enjoy debates and can still keep things              |
| friendly . They love the argum entative discourse and like it when          |
| their thoughts are said out loud and examined for a mutual give             |
| and take.                                                                   |
| ● They’re also the ones who have a hard time maintaining an                 |
| emotional situation. If the conversation needs them to be in                |
| touch with another person’ s feelings, then an ESTJ would be                |
| out the door or be very uncomfortable when participating.                   |
| ● Most ESTJs are attracted to the following careers: managers,              |
| administrators, judges, financial officers, teachers, insurance             |
| agents, underwriters, and nursing administrators.                           |
| So how do you connect with an ESTJ or make an impression with               |
| this personality type? Here are some tips to get you started:               |
| ● They receive information best via charts, graphs, or diagrams.            |
| ESTJs will definitely appreciate visual presentations of an idea,           |
| a thought, or a problem.                                                    |
| ● They’re the ones who like to talk over problems. They’re likely           |
| to discu ss the issues by going over the information with other             |
|                                                                             |

| people before concluding with possible answers. Hence, they’re              |
| the personality types who like to brainstorm in groups.                     |
| ENFJ – Extrovert, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging                               |
| They can be quite warm and engaging when in the presence of                 |
| others. ENFJs always make you feel included since they use a lot of         |
| “we” and “us” in their language. These extroverts are all about unity       |
| and helping each other achie ve a common goal. Here’ s what to look         |
| for when with a suspected ENFJ:                                             |
| ● They like in-depth conversations that are all about theories              |
| and possibilities. Remember , they’re intuitive so they tend to             |
| look towards the future.                                                    |
| ● They’re the ones who can anticipate the moods, emotions,                  |
| and feelings of other people. They’re good conversation alists              |
| and can impact talks in a way that everyone gets exactly what               |
| they need out of the conversation. The goal for them is to make             |
| sure everyone becomes enga ged and no one feels bored or left               |
| out.                                                                        |
| ● They can be very persuasive when it comes to things they                  |
| value, especia lly if they think it will help others. This can be           |
| both a good thing and a bad thing because their enthusiasm                  |
| can sometimes be too much, irritating others around them. If                |
| you’re the receptive kind, however , their enthusiasm can be                |
| very inspiring.                                                             |
| ● Take careful note of how they talk. As communicators, ENFJs               |
| like to use abstracts and metaphors to make their point. When               |
| talking about something they’re passionate about, they can                  |
| quickly tune out others and go of f on a tangent.                           |
| ● They’re not very good in impersonal situations. ENFJs need to             |
| feel constantly connected to people, which is why they avoid                |
| technical situa tions and focus instead on topics that have a               |
| positive impact on their surroundings.                                      |
| ● Typical careers for this type include teachers, psychiatris ts,           |
| counselors, the clergy , sales representatives, human                       |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 48 =====                                                         |
| resources, event coordinators , writers, musicians, and religious           |
| workers.                                                                    |
| ENTJ – Extrovert, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging                              |
| ENTJs are confident and businesslike. They make incredible                  |
| speeches that would make you think they’re visionaries. Like most           |
| extroverts, they like to vocalize their thoughts in order to facilitate     |
| processing them. Hence, they’re far more likely to talk during              |
| meetings or activities; this is simply how they handle tasks at hand,       |
| as talking creates a more concrete situation for them. Here are some        |
| of the characteristics to look at when you’re trying to identify an         |
| ENTJ:                                                                       |
| ● They love talking out their thoughts although during these                |
| conversations, they may seem like they’re laying out hard and               |
| fast judgment. This doesn’t mean they arrive at conclusions                 |
| quickly , it’s simply how they process new information best.                |
| ● They love to argue and debate over different theories. Their              |
| strengths usually lie on theoretical issues, however , rather than          |
| technical matters of debate.                                                |
| ● Don’t look at them weirdly if they talk to themselves. In many            |
| cases, this is also how ENTJs process their ideas. They also                |
| like to take notes, create charts, or make diagrams of situations           |
| in order to solve them.                                                     |
| ● They’re quick thinkers and tend to jump from one idea to the              |
| next when it comes to discussions. At first, the things they say            |
| can be confus ing as they tend to make future predictions that              |
| are hard to follow. Some decisions seem nonsensical, but all of             |
| these actually contribute towards a long-term plan.                         |
| ● They’re bad when discussing feelings and emotions. In fact,               |
| they prefer to keep things private, often seeing emotions as                |
| irrelevant or unimportant in their lives.                                   |
| ● These types tend to gravitate to careers as CEOs, founde rs of            |
| organizations, entrepreneurs, lawyers, judges, university                   |
| professors, bankers, scientists, and analysts.                              |
|                                                                             |

| ESTP – Extrovert, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving                             |
| They’re extroverts so they are going to love friendly and lively            |
| conversations and all the physical gestures that go with it. They will      |
| hook you in with engaging expressions and their quick wit makes             |
| them very enjoyable in parties.                                             |
| Here are some characterizes of the ESTP personality:                        |
| ● They’re excellent storytellers with a vocabulary that keeps               |
| them well-grounded and literal. They have the panache in the                |
| way they talk that people remain interested in what they have to            |
| say.                                                                        |
| ● In fact, ESTPs are fairly good with body language and can                 |
| easily detect the mannerisms of people around them. This                    |
| simply means that they know exactly what to do and say to                   |
| make a person smile, laugh, or feel better . Of course, this also           |
| means that they know what to say if they want to make                       |
| someone feel bad.                                                           |
| ● Despite being extroverts, ESTPs like to keep their thoughts               |
| tucked inside until they’re ready to voice them. Their decisions            |
| are internally analyzed and conclusions reached before they                 |
| speak out.                                                                  |
| ● They’re also very uncomfortable when asked to talk about                  |
| feelings. However , they are perfectly happy to swap stories or             |
| share experiences with other people.                                        |
| ● Although this isn’t 100 percent accurate, ESTPs are usually               |
| employed as sales represe ntatives, paramedics, computer                    |
| technicians, farmers, laborers, service workers, detec tives,               |
| military , audito rs, comedians , craft workers, and transportation         |
| operatives.                                                                 |
| So how do you talk to one? Here are some tips on how to                     |
| communicate with an ESTP:                                                   |
| ● Keep it friendly and straightforward. Simplicity is the key here.         |
| You don’t want to give them unnecessary detail as this will only            |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 50 =====                                                         |
| make an ESTP lose interest. Instead, lay down the facts as you              |
| know them and of fer evidence to support your claim.                        |
| ● Here is an important thing though—when presenting to an                   |
| ESTP , suggest several options that can help the ESTP make                  |
| his decision. He is still going to go through the raw facts, but he         |
| will appreciate the options you’ve laid out as this will speed up           |
| the decision process for him.                                               |
| ● Never underestimate their logical manner of thinking. This                |
| doesn’t mean you can’t question their analysis, you simply have             |
| to ask them how they arrived at a specific conclusion. The                  |
| ESTP will actually enjoy telling you how they got from point A to           |
| point B.                                                                    |
| ● Never rush an ESTP if you want to stay on their good side. Do             |
| not impose a time table or a chore chart and just expect them               |
| to follow through, especially if you don’t offer logical                    |
| explanations for it.                                                        |
| Communicating with the ENFJs, ENTJs, ESTJs, and ESTPs                       |
| These personality types like to be in charge and have no problem            |
| interacting with people. They’re the kind of people who can walk in a       |
| room and instantly gain the attention of others because they have           |
| such a commanding presenc e. Here are some tips on how to best              |
| communicate with these personality types:                                   |
| When greeting them, keep things friendly but brief. These                   |
| extrovert types don’t need the extended contact when it’s                   |
| not even necessary . The same goes for when you’re telling                  |
| them goodbye after a day’s work or some other social                        |
| event.                                                                      |
| Make direct eye contact when talking to them. Speak what                    |
| you want to say quickly after thinking it through. Let them                 |
| know what you want and why. They will appreciate this                       |
| kind of discourse instead of running around the issue.                      |
| Explain things in a clear and matter-of-fact manner . Keep                  |
| your words focused on a goal and try not to go off tangen t.                |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 51 =====                                                         |
| The important thing is to give them the main points and                     |
| nothing else.                                                               |
| Be honest if you don’t know the answer to a question. Tell                  |
| them instead that you’ll find out the answer as soon as                     |
| possible.                                                                   |
| Don’t be vague and interpret their words as is. If you                      |
| already know exactly what they’re telling you, then don’t try               |
| to extrapolate on possible other meanings. If something is                  |
| unclear , ask them outright. You should not be afraid about                 |
| clarifying thing s with this type as they prefer this to                    |
| someone who just “guesses” on what needs to be done.                        |
| Note that when stressed, these types tend to become                         |
| bossy . The best thing you can do is help them toward s                     |
| their goal and summon up a little humor to help with the                    |
| stress.                                                                     |
|                                                                             |

| Chapter 5: Communication Styles                                             |
| Communication style is defined as the way you exchange                      |
| information with other people . There are basically four styles known       |
| today: passive , aggressive, passive-aggressive, and assertive. It’s        |
| important to make a distinction between these four because the way          |
| information is communicated to you will af fect how you respond to it.      |
| One thing you have to understand though is that you can’t box               |
| people into single communication styles. People also change the             |
| way they communicate based on the results they want to get. Hence,          |
| it’s often best to classify the communication style as it comes. Here       |
| are the dif ferent types today:                                             |
| Passive                                                                     |
| Passive comm unication is all about hints. You don’t directly say           |
| something, you “hint” on it and expect the other person to get the          |
| hint. This is the lowest form of communication and actually puts the        |
| burden on the person receiving the message. Simply put, when                |
| you’re communicating on a passive level, you expect the other               |
| person to correctly interpret information that you sent vaguely . It can    |
| be problematic as interpreta tion may not always fit the intended           |
| message. This leads to conflicts, misunderstanding, and sometimes           |
| even resentment on the part of the people communicating.                    |
| How do you know when someone is trying to tell you something                |
| different from what they’re actually saying? Passive communication          |
| usually has the following body language tells:                              |
| Lack of eye contact or in some cases, extreme eye contact                   |
| Dropped shoulders and hunched back                                          |
| Keep their head down                                                        |
| Low voice                                                                   |
| Putting emphasis on certain words                                           |
| May repeat sentences in an effort to communicate what                       |
| they’re trying to say                                                       |

| May say phrases like: “It really doesn’t matter” or “As long                |
| as everyone is happy”                                                       |

| Aggressive                                                                  |
| Aggressive communication isn’t something you can just ignore. If            |
| someone communicates information in an aggressive manner , you              |
| will be able to tell. It has the following signs:                           |
| Loud and demanding voice                                                    |
| There are threats, criticisms, blames, intimidation, or any                 |
| other tactic to compel you into doing what they want                        |
| Aggressive posture                                                          |
| Intense eye contact                                                         |
| Aggressive communication isn’t so much about conveying                      |
| information but rather , telling a person what they should do. This isn’t   |
| always a negative thing as aggressiveness can be interp reted as a          |
| sign of leaders hip. It can extend to confrontations or telling people      |
| exactly what they think without regard of circumstances, reactions, or      |
| feelings.                                                                   |
| Passive-Aggressive                                                          |
| The passive-aggressive manner of communication is perhaps the               |
| most frustrating for both the sender and the receiver . It’s a subtle       |
| combination of the two previous communication styles, allowing a            |
| person to appear passive on the surface but with a hint of                  |
| aggressiveness under the layer of passivity .                               |
| What are the typical signs of this communication style? Watch out for       |
| these:                                                                      |
| Muttering under their breath instead of confronting a                       |
| person                                                                      |
| Agreeing verbally but doing something else entirely                         |
|                                                                             |

| Denying the existence of a problem despite body language                    |
| showing opposition or reluctance                                            |
| Silent treatment                                                            |
| Spreading rumors or talking behind someone’ s back                          |
| Saying things like, “I’m okay with it, but someone else may                 |
| not like it.”                                                               |
| People who are passive-aggressive often feel powerless and stuck            |
| on their situation. You’d find that when a person has had enough of         |
| passivity , they take up a notch towards passive-aggressive                 |
| communication. Of course, for some people, this is their default            |
| setting.                                                                    |
| Assertive                                                                   |
| Of all the comm unication styles, this is perhaps the best one as well      |
| as being the most effective. Assertiveness is a manner of                   |
| communicating what you want to do without (hopefully) hurting               |
| anyone’ s feelings. It’s not very important if you have the same goal       |
| and mindset as other people. If that’s the case, then all you have to       |
| do is agree with each other . Assertiveness comes to the surface            |
| when you want to have an open communication with anoth er person,           |
| allowing both of you to express your thoughts, ideas, feelings,             |
| desires, and needs—without causing friction. The goal is to create a        |
| balance so that all parties come out of the conversation content.           |
| How do you do this? An assertive communicator has the following             |
| characteristics:                                                            |
| Uses “I” statements. Contrar y to what you may think, this does not         |
| translate selfishness but simply validates what you feel without            |
| putting blame on other peopl e. Words like “I feel frustrated ” or “I feel  |
| helpless” lets other people into your thoughts, giving them room to         |
| adjust and empathize with your situation. It allows you to claim            |
| ownership over what you feel and the behaviors that go along with           |
| that feeling.                                                               |
|                                                                             |

| Maintain contact. Contact can be in the form of eye contact                 |
| or if you’re comfortable with it, a physical contact.                       |
| Smile and assume a positive posture. Listen to what                         |
| people have to say but make sure that you get your own                      |
| time to speak.                                                              |
| If you want to be assertive, make sure to address any                       |
| objections on a point by point basis. Repeat what they said                 |
| and address each one individually until you’ve tackled all                  |
| the issues raised. You can then present your own, provide                   |
| the benefits for it, bring forth a call to action to encourage              |
| people to join in.                                                          |
| Keep your tone calm and low without any hint of smugness                    |
| or superiority . In many cases, people resist new ideas                     |
| simply because of the speaker or the way the new idea is                    |
| introduced in a conversation. You want to make it as gentle                 |
| and as friendly as possibl e to help people be more                         |
| welcoming to the idea.                                                      |
|                                                                             |

| Chapter 6: Reading Lies in People                                           |
| One of the most valuable skills when reading people is being able to        |
| tell when they’re lying. Admit it—you’ve always wanted to know              |
| when someone is lying to you, and that’s perfectly okay. Studies            |
| show that when lying, some people have specific “tells,” such as            |
| scratching their nose or brushing their hair with their fingers. People     |
| who play poker often use these “tells” to see if they should match the      |
| other person’ s bet and whether it would be worth the trouble.              |
| One thing I want to remind you of is that reading lies in a person is       |
| not an exact science. People’ s actions when lying can vary, which is       |
| why familiarity is important. The longer you know a person , the more       |
| accurate your prediction will be about the truthfulness of what they’re     |
| saying.                                                                     |
| So, those being the case, here are the typical signs of lying               |
| according to experts.                                                       |
| Understanding a Baseline                                                    |
| One thing I want you to remember is that when reading body                  |
| language, there’s usually a “baseline” that allows you to start             |
| somewhere. A baseline is simply the “normal” way in which a person          |
| acts when around people. Hence, if a person is being truthful and           |
| confident in their surrounding s, how exactly do they act? Knowing a        |
| person’ s basel ine lets you know when they’re acting out of character .    |
| Sure, you can walk into a room full of strangers and do a casual            |
| “read” of the room, but readin g people close to you is often easier as     |
| you’ve known them for a longer period of time. You have a point of          |
| reference, to put it simply .                                               |
| As mentioned, people have varied “lying” gestures. Some people just         |
| love to talk with their hands while other people just love to fidget with   |
| their hair on normal days. Hence, seeing them do this doesn’t               |
| automatically mean they are lying, it might simply be a part of their       |
| personality .                                                               |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 57 =====                                                         |
| Hand Movements                                                              |
| People lying tend to use gestures, but they do it after speaking.           |
| Typically , you’d find people gesturing while talking becaus e this is a    |
| natural part of the process. Their body is working with the mind in         |
| telling a story or conveying a message. In contrast, a person lying is      |
| focusing too much in making up the story that the body fails to catch       |
| up. Hence, they make up the lie first, and then perform the gestures        |
| to emphasize their point. Also take note that gestures of people who        |
| are lying often involves both hands as opposed to truthful people           |
| who only use one hand. This was noted after a 2015 study about              |
| people testifying in court cases.                                           |
| Another uncon scious body language done by lying people is keeping          |
| their palms away from you. It is just like a subliminal way of holding      |
| information away from other people. Hence, they may put their               |
| hands in their pocket or keep them close to their body , as if they’re      |
| trying to keep something a secret inside their palms. So basically ,        |
| people who lie can go two ways with their hands: they can either use        |
| them too much or not at all.                                                |
| Itching and Fidgeting                                                       |
| There’ s a popular belief that when a person lies, they tend to scratch     |
| their nose. This isn’t true 100% of the time—but it does bear noting        |
| in many cases. It’s fairly normal for people to have an itching             |
| sensation or fidget in their seat when they’re uncomfortable; the           |
| body naturally looks for a way to distract itself. Also note that when      |
| lying, people are often nervous of what they’re saying, which causes        |
| the autonomic nervous system to fluctuate thus creating that tingling       |
| sensation all over the body . It’s a lot like the nerves you get when       |
| you sit close to someone you like during those younger days.                |
| However , nose scratching isn’t the only itching movement associated        |
| with lying. When people lie, they can play with their hair, play with       |
| their fingers, scribble on a notebook, or perhaps the most go-to            |
| technique nowadays—they play with their phones.                             |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 58 =====                                                         |
| Facial Expressions                                                          |
| Of course, let us not forget how the face itself can signify when           |
| someone is lying. The eyes in particular can tell you so much               |
| depending on when a person chooses to look at you and when they             |
| choose to look away . Looking too much or not looking at all can be         |
| indicative of lying. Some people prefer to meet your gaze when lying        |
| because they “think” this will impress upon you their sincerity . Non-      |
| experienced liars tend to look away when uttering a lie. Hence, it can      |
| be a little confusing when judging people simply through their eyes.        |
| This is why it’s important to have a baseline when it comes to              |
| people, as I will be explain ing later on. One thing I want you to          |
| remember though is that a 2012 study published by PLOS One has              |
| already debunked the popular myth about where a person looks                |
| when lying. The myth goes that when a person is fabricating                 |
| something, they’re looking left and when they’re recalling something,       |
| they’re looking right. This is not true as the direction people look is     |
| largely based on their mannerisms. That being the case, try not to          |
| focus too much on the direction and simply on the overall                   |
| mannerisms of the person.                                                   |
| Change in Complexion                                                        |
| This one’s pretty obvious, as you read about it every day or see it as      |
| it happe ns every day. People blush, people become red, and people          |
| become pale depending on the circumstances. People tend to                  |
| become pale when they’re nervous or when they’re afraid of                  |
| something. When the skin turns a shade of red, however , that’s             |
| indicative of anger or perhaps even excitement, like when a teenager        |
| typically blushes when sitting beside their crush.                          |
| Sweat in the T Zone                                                         |
| This is something you definitely have to watch out for when                 |
| wondering if a person is lying to you or not. The T Zone covers the         |
| area of the nose and across the forehead and then down to your              |
| mouth. Sweati ng is fairly common in this area if a person is lying,        |
| especially if they’re nervous about it.                                     |
|                                                                             |

| Tone of Voice                                                               |
| Obviously , we’re trying to focus on non-verbal communication here,         |
| but the tone of voice is still a strong indicator , absent the words        |
| themselves. High-pitched voices tend to come out of nervo us people         |
| as the vocal cords tighten, making it hard to push out the particular       |
| words. There can also be a croak, a stutter , or some broken words          |
| coming out of a nervous individual. Some people clear their throat to       |
| help improve their speech, which is also indicative of nervousness.         |
| In contrast, a loud and booming voice can be a sign of confidence or        |
| anger , depending on the situation. A sudden change in the volume           |
| can also be defensiveness in people, especially when confronted             |
| with possible mistakes.                                                     |
| The Mouth                                                                   |
| Playing with the lips, such as rolling them backwards until they            |
| almost disappe ar, is another good indicator . It’s typically a sign of     |
| lying by omission as people physically try to hold back a word or a         |
| thought by pulling in their lips. If it goes the other way, however , it    |
| can be a sign of resistance or when a person doesn’t want to talk           |
| about something.                                                            |
| The Words Themselves                                                        |
| Again, we’re trying to focus on the non-verbal way of communicating,        |
| but I still want to cover all bases. After all, experienced liars can       |
| easily control their body langu age to match the situation. Hence, you      |
| still have to listen to the word s themselves as they can indicate when     |
| a person is trying too hard to convince you of their truthfulness.          |
| Some common phrases used by liars include:                                  |
| “Honestly…”                                                                 |
| “Let me tell you the truth…”                                                |
| “Uh…”                                                                       |
| “Like…”                                                                     |
| “Um…”                                                                       |

| Chapter 7: Understanding People’s Motivations                               |
| In the previous chapter we talked about lying and how to more or            |
| less tell when someone is lying to you. If you watched House , you’ll       |
| remember a quote by that famous doctor Gregory House that goes:             |
| “Everybody lies; the only variable is about what.”                          |
| So basically , what we’re trying to say is that you may be able to tell     |
| when someon e is lying, but can you tell what they’re lying about,          |
| what they’re covering up, or basically what the motivation is behind        |
| the lie?                                                                    |
| In this chapter , we’re going to talk about the motivations of people.      |
| It’s the principal thing that keeps them going and if you want to be        |
| able to read a person’ s body language correctly , you need to be able      |
| to unde rstand the motivations that drive them towards that end goal.       |
| Think of this as driving on a highway . Every person is driving towards     |
| a destination which is their main motivation. If you’re driving right       |
| alongside them , you might not be 100% sure of where they’re going.         |
| However , if you take a good look at the car’s movements, the               |
| blinkers, the position on the lane, and so on, you should be able to        |
| make a close-to-accurate prediction and therefore adjust your own           |
| driving accordingly . Even if a person lies to you, knowing what            |
| motivates them or what their “end game” is can help you figure out          |
| what the lie is all about.                                                  |
| This one is going to be a little more dif ficult so bear with me as we go   |
| through this. One more note, motives are defined as the conscious           |
| or unconscious moving factors for people’ s behavio rs. These               |
| motives are the reasons we do what we do. Behaviors are the                 |
| performances themselves or the actuations that are reflective of a          |
| person’ s motivation.                                                       |
| Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs                                                 |
| This is possibly one of the oldest rationales for understand ing human      |
| motivation. It’s not perfect, but what is? Maslow’ s Hierarchy of Needs     |
| is a lot like the Nutrition Pyramid. It explains that motives have a        |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 61 =====                                                         |
| bottom-up approach. The bottom needs are the most basic and                 |
| prevalent which must be met first before the others needs are               |
| addressed. There are five levels to basic human need, starting from         |
| the bottom, and these are: Physiological, Safety , Love/ Belonging,         |
| Esteem, and Self-Actualization.                                             |
| Here is a brief look at how this works:                                     |
| Physiological Needs                                                         |
| These are the main components that are aimed towards survival.              |
| According to Maslow’ s theory , humans are compelled to fulfill these       |
| needs first before they can ascend to higher levels. So what exactly        |
| are these physiological needs? These are:                                   |
| Homeostasis, or basically the balance of the body in order                  |
| to preserve its living condition                                            |
| Health                                                                      |
| Food                                                                        |
| Water                                                                       |
| Sleep                                                                       |
| Clothes                                                                     |
| Shelter                                                                     |
| Safety Needs                                                                |
| After a person meets their basic physiological needs, the next step is      |
| their safety needs. Here are the typical considerations when it comes       |
| to safety needs:                                                            |
| Personal security                                                           |
| Emotional security                                                          |
| Financial security                                                          |
| Health and wellbeing                                                        |
| Safety needs against accidents and illnesses                                |
| How do these things usually show themselves in an individual? You           |
| can see this by the way individuals purchase insurance policies, set        |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 62 =====                                                         |
| up a retirement account, get jobs with security , get a savings             |
| account, and so on. Of course, you also have to consider people             |
| who are in war zones who are seeking out security in its most basic         |
| form: physical security . You will find that when in the midst of war,      |
| people seek security to maintain homeostasis or the security of             |
| staying alive.                                                              |
| Social Belonging                                                            |
| Once you have the most basic needs and security , the next step is to       |
| seek out social belonging. We are social animals after all and the          |
| need to be accepted by our peers is one of the most comm on driving         |
| forces for people. The need for social belonging is typica lly met by       |
| the following:                                                              |
| Friendships                                                                 |
| Intimacy                                                                    |
| Family                                                                      |
| The need to be accepted in social groups is true regardless of the          |
| size of the group itself. This is why even when a person forms part of      |
| a small club in school, they still need to be part of the social circle     |
| within that club. Small social connections include family , friends, and    |
| colleagues in the typical workforce. You will notice that most people       |
| will go to extra lengths in order to have this sense of acceptance and      |
| belongingness in their chosen social circle. Failure to meet these          |
| needs lead to problems like social anxiety , clinical depression, and       |
| loneliness.                                                                 |
| Self-Esteem                                                                 |
| Fourth is self-esteem which is somehow connected to the third level.        |
| One thing you’ll notice is that most people use the third level to jump     |
| to the fourth. Acceptance in their social circle tends to promote a         |
| person’ s self-esteem as they find themselves worthy because others         |
| find them worth y. What does this level cover? There are actually two       |
| version of this: the lower and the higher version. The higher version       |
| speaks of self-esteem derived from others. There’ s a need for status,      |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 63 =====                                                         |
| fame, prestige, recognition, and attention from others. This is the one     |
| I was mentioning before.                                                    |
| The more difficult version is the higher one which spea ks of self-         |
| esteem deriving from your own competency . This speaks of self-             |
| confidence, of knowing that you’re capable of independence. This            |
| means being able to take care of yourself, know your needs, and             |
| have the ability to meet those needs. This gives an individual a            |
| sense of value and prevents the possibility of having an inferiority        |
| complex.                                                                    |
| Self-Actualization                                                          |
| This is the toughest level of the motivation pyramid and is all about       |
| managing to reach a person’ s full potential. Maslow describes it as        |
| the ability of an individual to accomplish everything they can possibly     |
| achieve in life. It is a lifetime goal and for many people, it can be       |
| difficult to actually pinpoint that lifetime goal. Others, however , know   |
| what this goal is but have a hard time reaching the lower levels.           |
| Self-actualization can include:                                             |
| Parenting                                                                   |
| Partner acquisition                                                         |
| Utilizing and developing abilities                                          |
| Utilizing and developing talents                                            |
| Pursuing other goals                                                        |
| These self-actualization motives are described by Maslow as the             |
| intrinsic drive that pushes people forward into completion. People          |
| who have a clear grasp of this goal need to understand how their            |
| four needs in the pyramid interact with each other to help them             |
| achieve the ultimate goal.                                                  |
| The Sixth Level - T ranscendence                                            |
| Oddly enough, the developer of this hierarchy has also talked about         |
| a sixth level. He called it Transcendence and according to him, it is a     |
| level of achievement where a person surrenders himself to                   |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 64 =====                                                         |
| something or someone more powerful than himself. Y ou are probably          |
| thinking about religion, but that’s not all there is to it. Transcendence   |
| is also pursued through meditative exercises. According to him,             |
| transcendence refers to the highest and most holistic level of human        |
| consciousness.                                                              |
| So How Does This Help with Reading People?                                  |
| If we rely completely on Maslow’ s Hierarchy of Needs, you’ll note          |
| that most people’ s actions are built towards reaching any of these         |
| five needs. It can be a tad difficult, but what you want to do is try to    |
| figure which of these five needs a person wants to achieve when             |
| confronted with a particular behavior . Do they want social                 |
| acceptance? Do they want to achieve the basic necessities of                |
| maintaining life? Or do they want to have a sense of security? If you       |
| can figure out exactly what ultimate need one wants to fulfill, you can     |
| at least fill in the gaps in betw een and make a reading on what their      |
| body is saying.                                                             |
| Experience Matters when it comes to Motives                                 |
| Obviously , there is a lot more to motivation than just figuring out        |
| which of the five needs a person wants to meet. The fact is that            |
| experience is a big predictor when it comes to figuring out                 |
| motivations. Plus, it’s on a case by case basis, with YOU as a big          |
| factor in the equation. Simply put—what does this person want from          |
| me? What need is this person trying to fulfill through me? What need        |
| can I fill for this person?                                                 |
| Guidelines for Understanding People                                         |
| Let’s say you’re ready to figure out people’ s motivations and              |
| understand them to forge better connections. The question now is            |
| this: how do you start? The way you start varies from person to             |
| person, but there are certain “general rules” that can help you move        |
| forward with connections.                                                   |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 65 =====                                                         |
| Here are some of the typica l guidelines to make things easier for          |
| you:                                                                        |
| Most social behaviors are hidden.                                           |
| We’ve been talking about the different actions of people and what           |
| they mean, but it’s also important to look at the opposite end of the       |
| scale. You should keep in mind that more often than not, people             |
| draw in instead of pushing out. Many actions or reactions are done in       |
| order to suppress rather than express. For example, people close            |
| their arms, suck in their lips, or look away from people. It’s a pull       |
| motion rather than a push. How does this apply when you’re trying to        |
| connect with people?                                                        |
| Well now, you have to pay extra attention. There’ s this precious           |
| moment betwe en a push and a pull when a person starts to react             |
| about somethi ng and then quickly hold that back in because they            |
| realize that they’re showing emotions and feelings they don’t want          |
| people to see. That’ s the moment you have to watch out for looking         |
| at people.                                                                  |
| Now, you might not always catch this deliberate inaction, but               |
| knowing that they’re there is half the battle. More importantly , this      |
| should tell you that a lot of things are beneath the surfa ce. This is      |
| why you need to focus on empathy , delving deep into the surface            |
| instead of just interpreting what people say without applying               |
| empathy . Put yourself in the person’ s shoes and you shou ld be able       |
| to at least have an idea of what they’re trying to do or what they’re       |
| trying to achieve.                                                          |
| Conceit trumps malice.                                                      |
| Another thing to keep in mind is that people aren’t naturally evil. If      |
| you’re going to guess a person’s motivation, malice should NOT be           |
| your first choice. In law, accused people are often considered              |
| “innocent until proven guilty” because the default setting is that a        |
| person is “good” unless there’s enough evidence to show that                |
| they’ve been bad. This is also important if you want to understand          |
| people better .                                                             |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 66 =====                                                         |
| In any situation where people are doing something that is harmful to        |
| others, first assume that they’re doing it because they’re unaware or       |
| ignorant, or believe that their way is more important. By having this       |
| mindset, you are more likely to react in a kinder manner . Chances          |
| are you’d react by explaining to them exactly why their choice of           |
| action is not the best one. In contrast, walking into a situation           |
| believing a person is simply “evil” makes you react badly, perhaps          |
| even rudely or even violently .                                             |
| Selfish altruism often dictates behavior .                                  |
| Selfishness is often viewed as a desire to please only yourself while       |
| altruism is its exact opposite. Altruistic people are said to be selfless   |
| or want only the best for others. Oddly enough, people are driven by        |
| these two factors at the same time. Perhaps the simplest way to             |
| explain this is: people are giving, but they are giving in a way that       |
| also helps themselves. For example, people have no problem                  |
| lending money to a friend, knowing that this particular friend can help     |
| them fix their computer or fix their car without charge. You trade in a     |
| car from a dealer and the two of you benefit. In some cases, helping        |
| someone is a sign that you have more power than that person,                |
| therefore helping you establis h a feeling of dominance over another        |
| person.                                                                     |
| Memory is fickle.                                                           |
| Another thing that might help you in understanding people for the           |
| better is that they don’t have excellent memories. Memory is                |
| incredibly fickle for people and people are likely to forget certain        |
| things, ideas, or concepts. Hence, if you’re expecting someone to           |
| call or someone promised to do something for you, you can always            |
| assume it’s because they simply forgot instead of deliberate malice.        |
| Do not go this route and assume that people are naturally evil as this      |
| will leave you feeling bitter and closed to the possibility of connecting   |
| and understan ding others. You can also make this memory work in            |
| your favor. This is because when it comes to connecting with others,        |
| people are more likely to remember you if there are similarities as         |
| opposed to dissimilarities.                                                 |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 67 =====                                                         |
| People are more emotional than they let on.                                 |
| Have you ever looked at someone being given surprising news and             |
| they seem to have very little reaction to it? The truth is that people      |
| are more emotional than they let on. There’ s something seething            |
| there beneath the surface and it’s important to recognize that              |
| emotion even if you don’t see it bubble out. It’s perfectly normal for      |
| people to hold their feelings in; outbursts are usually frown ed upon in    |
| society and flamboyant enthusiasm is discouraged. This is especially        |
| true for men so if you are trying to figure out a significant man in your   |
| life, you have to remember that they may not always be displaying           |
| their actual thoughts and emotions. Do not call people out on it            |
| unless you have to, but take it into consideration when interacting         |
| with them.                                                                  |
| Unfortunately , the reverse of this holds true too. Unless you have         |
| made a full display of emotions or had a breakdown, people                  |
| generally assu me you’re okay and act as if nothing has changed. It         |
| can be quite frustrating if you’re the one who’s suppressing your           |
| emotions, but it feels perfectly fine for those at the other end. If        |
| you’re on the opposite side of the situation (which means you’re the        |
| one holding in your emotions ), then do not take it personally . Don’t      |
| assume that they should know your thoughts because people can               |
| only see as much as you allow them to see.                                  |
|                                                                             |

| Chapter 8: Reading the Face and Body – Cues                                 |
| and What They Mean                                                          |
| Body language is a wide field and contrary to what you may think, it’ s     |
| not just the “body” per se but also covers facial expressions, posture,     |
| gesture, eye movements, body movement, and even the lack of                 |
| body movement itself. Body language is not unique to humans                 |
| though; in fact, it’s very obvious if you watch animals during their        |
| mating season. The dances and postures are hardly subtle as they            |
| do their best to attract the opposite sex.                                  |
| But what about us humans? Body language in humans is far more               |
| complicated so you’ll have to be doubly observant. Unlike animals,          |
| there are lots of possible motivations that affect our body language.       |
| Even worse, some people make it a point of controlling their body’ s        |
| natural reaction or make sure that nothing shows through their body         |
| and facial expressions. Sometimes, they even fake those postures to         |
| give others the wrong impression. Just watch a poker tournament             |
| and you’ll see exactly what I mean.                                         |
| The Science of Body Language                                                |
| One thing you should note is that body language reading is not some         |
| pseudoscience. It has actual ly been studied for years and has been         |
| solidified by legitimate studies. Today , the science of studying body      |
| language is called Kinesics and was founded by Ray Birdwhistell. It         |
| covers the following actions or conditions:                                 |
| ● Facial expressions                                                        |
| ● Body posture                                                              |
| ● Eye movement                                                              |
| ● Use of space                                                              |
| ● Touch                                                                     |
| ● Gestures                                                                  |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 69 =====                                                         |
| Facial Expressions                                                          |
| How good are you at reading facial expressions? There are currently         |
| tests online that tells you whether you’re good at reading facial           |
| expressions or not. In fact, some tests like Reading the Mind in the        |
| Eyes Test checks to see whether you can read a person’ s mind               |
| simply by looking at their eyes. If you’re interested in taking the test    |
| yourself, check the website: socialintelligence.labinthewild.org/mite.      |
| See how well you fare and then just come back to this book if you           |
| want. For purposes of improving communication, we’re going to               |
| include all the elements that are included in reading facial                |
| expressions, which involves the eyes, eyebrows, lips, nose, and             |
| even the wrinkles around the eyes and mouth.                                |
| ● Pupil – There is practically no way to fake the movement of               |
| the pupils when reading facial expressions. The pupils of the               |
| eye contract and expand without any sort of control on the part             |
| of a person. Typically , the pupils will expand when a person is            |
| interested and contract when they’re not.                                   |
| ● Blinking Motion – The eyes typically blink six to ten times per           |
| minute. When a person looks at something they find interesting,             |
| however , that blinking rate slows down drastically . It’s therefore        |
| a great indicator when someone finds something interesting or               |
| attractive. In fact, it’ s often used as a sign of flirting or interest in  |
| a roman tic setting. In an office or social setting, unblinking eyes        |
| could be a signal that a person is very interested in what you              |
| have to say and listening to you throughout.                                |
| ● Raising the head – Raising the head from a lowered position               |
| is a sign of captured interest . Think of a student who’s looking           |
| down during an exam who suddenly raises their head when                     |
| they hear something important. This is the kind of movement                 |
| that we are trying to describe in this situation.                           |
| ● Head tilt – A head tilt usually starts from a normal position of          |
| the head and then juts out at an angle. This is what makes it               |
| different from the motion of raising your head from a lowered               |
| position. A head tilt also indicates interest, usually towards the          |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 70 =====                                                         |
| person or activity where it happens to be tilted to. When                   |
| combined with facial expressions like a narrowing of the                    |
| eyebrows, it can be a sign of confusion, curiosity , questio ning,          |
| or unce rtainty . A head that’s tilted backwards may be a sign of           |
| suspicion.                                                                  |
| Of course, let’s not forget the typical head gestures that mean             |
| practically the same for everyone. These are:                               |
| ● Nodding – usually signifies agreement                                     |
| ● Shaking the head – usually signifies disagreement                         |
| What’ s important about these gestures is that people are often             |
| conscious about doing this. Hence, it can be easily controlled by           |
| them, dependi ng on the situa tion. Some are able to stop the motion        |
| entirely while others turn it into very subtle gestures so that it would    |
| be very dif ficult to notice.                                               |
| Hands, Arms, and Gestures                                                   |
| ● Shrug – A shrug is composed of multiple gestures which                    |
| include exposed palms, hunc hed shoulders, and raised brows.                |
| It’s a univers al sign that indicates lack of knowledge or                  |
| uncertainty over a particular activity . It can often be translated         |
| as a sign that the other person doesn’t know what you’re saying             |
| or doesn’t understand what you’re trying to convey .                        |
| ● Clenched Hand s – Clenched hands are a sign of repression.                |
| You’re trying to prevent the burst of emotions like anger or                |
| frustration. It’s a self-containment mechanism often used by                |
| people who don’t want to do or say something out of order. In               |
| some cases, you can read this gesture as a sign that someone                |
| has a closed mind on what you’re trying to say. In the                      |
| alternative, open and relaxed hands are a sign of comfort and               |
| show a positive attitude with a mind welcome to new ideas.                  |
| ● Hand Wringing – This is often interpreted as a sign of anxiety            |
| or nervousness. Playing with something in your hands also has               |
| the same interpretation.                                                    |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 71 =====                                                         |
| ● Handshake – You have to be careful with handshakes as this                |
| can tell so much about a person and vice versa. I’m sure you’ve             |
| managed to have presumptions of people simply because of                    |
| the way they shook your hand. The best handshake is often                   |
| considered to be a firm, dry grip, that’s quick but not too long. It        |
| shouldn’t be too tight as to cause pain, but it should be strong            |
| enough to signify competence on the part of the person shaking              |
| their hand. My advice is you practice your handshake with                   |
| another person to help you decide on the best pressure to use               |
| when greeting someone this way. Note though—not all cultures                |
| accept handshakes as a viable way of greeting others. For                   |
| example, people in India or those who practice the Muslim faith             |
| do not approve of handshakes as a way of greeting between                   |
| men and women.                                                              |
| ● Covering the mouth – Doing this is often shown as a sign of               |
| repression, like a person wanted to say something but decided               |
| against it at the last minute. Some people use this gesture as a            |
| way to show thinking or a thought process.                                  |
| Body Posture and Movement                                                   |
| You’ve probably noticed that reading body language involves paying          |
| attention to different parts of the body all at once. Some gestures are     |
| centered in just one area, like the face, and therefore are slightly        |
| easier than others. Some gestures, however , are scatter ed all over        |
| the body, which means that different parts are moving all at once.          |
| This makes it tougher to do a reading, but you’ll find that with            |
| practice, the whole thing becomes easier .                                  |
| Body posture and movement is a big predictor of a person’ s thoughts        |
| and emotions. The general position of the chest, shoulders, legs,           |
| and so on will tell you if a person is aggressive, afraid, unsure,          |
| excited, and so on. Here are some of the typical changes in the body        |
| and what they indicate:                                                     |
| ● A pumped out chest is a sign of power and dominance.                      |
| Typically , when the chest is spread out, the shoulders are also            |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 72 =====                                                         |
| stretched into a straight line, pushing the chest forward and               |
| making the person appear bigger . Combined with hands placed                |
| on the hips and this can be dubbed as the “Superman” pose                   |
| which makes a person appear bigger and occupy more space.                   |
| This is often seen as a sign of confidence and dominance. If                |
| you’ll notice, many animals in the wild, when protecting their              |
| territory or trying to attract a mate, tend to make their bodies            |
| appear bigger so that they’ll be easily noticed. Men and women              |
| do the same thing and often for the same reasons.                           |
| ● Touching the chest can also be a sign of sincerity . You’ll notice        |
| how people do this when they’re trying to apologize or                      |
| communicate how bad they feel or their condolences to another               |
| person.                                                                     |
| ● Scratching or touching the chest can also be a sign of                    |
| discomfort.                                                                 |
| Breathing                                                                   |
| Breathing can tell you a lot about what a person feels. You’ve              |
| probably notic ed this already , not just in other people but also in       |
| yourself. For example, you might hold your breath when excited or           |
| take short and shallow breaths when scared. Typically , deep and            |
| even breaths are indicative of relaxation, such as when you’re              |
| sleeping or when you’re sitting down watching a relaxing movie.             |
| Excessive, shallow , or holdin g your breath, on the other hand, can        |
| be a sign of emotional turmoil. According to experts, mirroring a           |
| person’ s breathing pattern can also help forge a connection of             |
| mutual unders tanding between the two of you. Being able to match           |
| someone’ s breathing pattern essentially allows you to create a sense       |
| of norm alcy in the situation, thereby pulling them into a sense of         |
| relaxation. Of course, this takes some skill to do, espec ially if the      |
| situation is really nerve wracking. At the very least, being able to        |
| identify nervous breathing patterns can help you adjust your stance         |
| to make the other person feels comfortable—all without a word said          |
| to each other .                                                             |

| Proxemics                                                                   |
| An excellent non-verbal way of communication is proxemics, which            |
| is the measurable distan ce between people. Basically , it                  |
| characterizes relationships between people depending on their               |
| preferred distances in given situations. People often have personal         |
| space or a perceived territory that they’re uncomfortable sharing with      |
| others. Think of this in a social setting. Would you feel comfortable if    |
| someone you met for the first time stands just mere inches away             |
| from you? Of course not! But if you’re with your spouse or partner ,        |
| you have no problem holding hands or putting your arms around               |
| each other . This is exactly what proxemics looks into and fortunately ,    |
| the developer (Edward T. Hall) has done his research. He managed            |
| to write down the specifics of proximity and what they often indicate       |
| of relationships between people. Note that this proximity usually           |
| refers to men as women usually have a different idea on what the            |
| proper distance is in dif ferent situations:                                |
| Intimate Distance                                                           |
| This covers situations of touching, embracing, or even whispering           |
| ● Close – less than 6 inches                                                |
| ● Far – 6 to 18 inches                                                      |
| Personal Distance                                                           |
| This typically involves interactions between family members or good         |
| friends                                                                     |
| ● Close – 1.5 to 2.5 feet                                                   |
| ● Far – 2.5 to 4 feet                                                       |
| Social Distance                                                             |
| This is the typical distance between acquaintances                          |
| ● Close – 4 to 7 feet                                                       |
| ● Far – 7 to 12 feet                                                        |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 74 =====                                                         |
| Public Distance                                                             |
| This is the distance used for public speaking purposes                      |
| ● Close – 12 to 25 feet                                                     |
| ● Far – 25 feet or more                                                     |
| It’s also important to note that distance can affect the posture or         |
| gestures of people. This is because there are instances when people         |
| don’t have a say on the distan ce they have with others. For example,       |
| if you’re in a cramped elevator or in a commercial airline, you do not      |
| exactly have the option of moving your body farther away from               |
| another person. In these instances, the rest of the body                    |
| compensates by taking on some other form or angle relative to their         |
| position. This is why people in a cramped elevator tend to focus on         |
| their phones or look at any other direction aside from the person           |
| they’re next to. In the altern ative, people who are in an intimate         |
| relationship, or would like to be in an intimate relationship, tend to sit  |
| close to each other often.                                                  |
| Remember what we said about culture in a previous chapter though?           |
| Acceptable proximity range varies from culture to culture. For              |
| example, touching cheeks with each other can be a typical greeting          |
| in some countries while in others; this is reserved for close family        |
| and friends.                                                                |
| Oculesics                                                                   |
| This is actually a subcategor y of body language. It focuse s primarily     |
| on the movement of the eye, gazes, and other eye-centric                    |
| movements that can help indicate what a person is thinking or               |
| feeling. Remember how people used to say the eyes are the                   |
| windows to the soul? Well, there’ s a little bit of truth into it and with  |
| oculesics, you can have a bit more insight (pardon the pun!) on how         |
| the eyes can tell you what a person thinks or feels without a single        |
| word being said. This body language technique is limited by culture,        |
| however , as eye gestures can change from one country to the next.          |
| For example, Latinos view extended eye contact as a sign of                 |
| aggression while in some cases, it can show interest in an individual.      |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 75 =====                                                         |
| Asians see eye contact as anger while with Anglo-Saxons, the                |
| gesture could mean that they are telling the truth.                         |
| Haptics                                                                     |
| Haptics is a non-verbal comm unication style that deals primarily with      |
| touching. Touching or skin-to -skin contact is perhaps the very first       |
| way people communicate. Parents communicate or connect with                 |
| their babies through touch via different gestures. In fact, according to    |
| the Body Language Project, touching is the most developed sense at          |
| birth. In day-to-day life, touching includes handshakes, pats on the        |
| back, ruffles of the hair, brushes of the cheek, and so on. It signifies    |
| communication at different levels, managing to showcase all kinds of        |
| emotions from excitement, happiness, anger , devastation, and               |
| disappointment.                                                             |
| Haptics currently has five categories of communication by touch:            |
| ● Functional or Professional. This one is pretty self-explanatory .         |
| Basically , it refers to touch made in the office setting. One thing        |
| you have to remember in the office however is that touching is              |
| rarely encouraged. While at work, you’re expected to maintain               |
| formal relation ships, which means that skin-to-skin contact is             |
| not well-received. So when is touching okay? Usually , touching             |
| gestures in the workplace are indicative of close friendship or             |
| sometimes a “congratulations” for a job well done. It’s a way of            |
| acknowledging that someone did well in their workplace, the                 |
| gesture often encompassing a slap on the back, a hands hake,                |
| or a simple squeezing motion of the shoulders.                              |
| ● Friendship or Warmth. This doesn’t really necessitate                     |
| explanation because friendly gestures may vary from one                     |
| person to the next. Women hug close while men tend to have                  |
| an energetic hug followed by a controlled slap on the back.                 |
| Some people do some air kisses; others do a compli cated                    |
| handshake routine, while others happily hug it out.                         |
| ● Social or Polite. These are the gestures you make in a                    |
| repetitive manner . They’re indicative of ritual reaction like how          |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 76 =====                                                         |
| you greet a friend, how you act upon meeting family mem bers,               |
| and so on. They’re the kind of actions you don’t think about                |
| doing because they form part of the usual interaction with other            |
| people.                                                                     |
| ● Love or Intimacy . This is all abou t emotional attachment and is         |
| usually displayed between romantic partners. They are public                |
| gestures that indicate that a person is “taken.” You’ve probably            |
| seen this through hand holding, an arm around the shou lders,               |
| or placing hands on the hips.                                               |
| ● Sexual or Arousal. This one’s a tad different to intimacy                 |
| because this has sex for its motivation. During these touches,              |
| the intent is to have sexual relations or perhaps right after one.          |
| It is often done in private although the extent of public display           |
| depends primarily on the culture of the people displaying it.               |
|                                                                             |

| Chapter 9: Verbal Cues – Reading Between the                                |
| Lines                                                                       |
| Like it or not, most communication nowadays is done through words           |
| -- either written or oral. With the internet, written communication         |
| through email or chat mess ages are becoming the norm, which                |
| means that your ability to read people shouldn’t be limited to just         |
| face-to-face conversations.                                                 |
| In this chapter , we’re going to do our best to decipher what people        |
| are really saying behind their words. Often dubbed as “reading              |
| between the lines” or “readi ng the room,” it’s important for you to        |
| make a distinction between what people SA Y and what they MEAN.             |
| A word of caution before we go any further: you should know that            |
| there are peop le who mean exactly what they say. Take a good look          |
| at the MBTI we talked about in a previous chapter . The NT types are        |
| usually the ones who will tell you exactly what they want and it would      |
| be in the most literal way possible—although, of course, this may           |
| vary depending on the situation and the unique style of the person.         |
| In these instances, I want you to follow a rule in law: when the words      |
| are clear , you interpret them as straightforward and apply                 |
| accordingly . Only when it is ambiguous and vague should you                |
| consider the other cues in deciphering exactly what a person is             |
| trying to say .                                                             |
| Being a Better Listener                                                     |
| Obviously , the first step in learning how to read between the lines is     |
| first listening with as much attention as you can muster . When             |
| listening, your main goal should be to learn new information. Don’t         |
| be one of those people who simply listens in order to be polite to the      |
| person talking . Instead, aim to find out something or glean                |
| information from them. You need to be curious about what the other          |
| person is saying; otherwise you won’t really absorb anything. Here’ s       |
| a test: if you walked out of a conversation without learnin g anything      |
| new, then you weren’t really listening.                                     |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 78 =====                                                         |
| How do you become a better listener? Here are some tips:                    |
| Ask More Questions                                                          |
| Asking questions actually tells a person that you are interested and        |
| listening to the words they say . More importantly , questions allow you    |
| to clarify the situation, makin g it easier for you to forge connections    |
| between the information being given. This makes it possi ble for you        |
| to simplify the image in your head, arrive at conclusions, and              |
| practice empathy or sympathy , as the case may be. Asking                   |
| questions allow s other people to elaborate and explain their position.     |
| More importantly , it encourages truthfulness in people because they        |
| feel compelled to tell you the unvarnished truth as recognition of the      |
| attention you are actually giving them.                                     |
| Practice Active Listening                                                   |
| This is a technique that’s been used for years and can help you             |
| really understa nd and create a story in your head. According to the        |
| director of the Center for Leadership at Northwestern University ,          |
| active listening is simply repeating back what the speaker just said to     |
| you. It’s like a little recap just to make sure that the two of you are on  |
| the same page. The fact is that while listening, there is lots of           |
| opportunity to misunderstand what the other person is saying. Active        |
| listening or a recap of what the other person said tells them that          |
| you’re on the same page or if not, it lets them correct any                 |
| misconceptions you might have about the situation.                          |
| Wait Before Responding                                                      |
| Except for the instances when you need clarification, it’s important to     |
| stay quiet until the speaker is finished. It’s a typical rule in debates,   |
| meetings, and conversations, but you’ll be surprised at how often           |
| people fail to follow this basic rule. The fact is that people can be so    |
| impatient that they don’t even bother listening to a proposal               |
| completely before deciding to voice their thoughts, opinions,               |
| arguments, or even agreements. This can be frustrati ng for the             |
| speaker and makes it imposs ible for you to fully absorb all the ideas      |
| at once. Also note that every interruption can distort the message the      |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 79 =====                                                         |
| person is trying to convey , therefore making it more difficult for them    |
| to explain their standpoint.                                                |
| Take Note of the T one                                                      |
| As we previou sly mentioned, the tone of voice can convey so much           |
| about a person. A low voice adds a sense of authority , a high-pitched      |
| one conveys nervousness, stammering can indicate doubt, and fast-           |
| paced words can indicate anxiety . Also paying attention to which           |
| words are given emphasis can change how the sentence is                     |
| perceived. For example, they may be putting emphasis on the word            |
| “maybe” or perhaps they stuttered the word “yes” as a reply . This          |
| could be indica tive that although they want to say NO, they’re put in      |
| the position where they can’t refuse.                                       |
| Take Note of the Modifying W ords                                           |
| During your first few years in school, you are taught about sentence        |
| structure. There’ s the subject and the verb. I ran. I walked. I ate.       |
| These are all complete sente nces and they’re as straightforward as         |
| they come. Even with those words, however , you can quickly tell            |
| something about the talker in that all of those things were done in the     |
| past. After all, all the verbs are used in the past tense.                  |
| Most sentences are not that simple. When speaking or writing,               |
| people use adjectives or adverbs. They use modifiers that lengthen          |
| the sentence while at the same time adding a bit more information           |
| on the activity and the speaker .                                           |
| For example, instead of “I walked,” the sentence is “I walked quickly .”    |
| Or instead of “I ate,” the sentence is “I ate fast food.”                   |
| The modifiers or added information in those sentences are “quickly”         |
| and “fast food.” They’re little clues that tell people more about what      |
| you are trying to say .                                                     |
| For example, “quickly” can imply several things depending on the            |
| situation. It could mean that a person is late, which is why they           |
|                                                                             |

| started to walk quickly . It could mean that they’re trying to catch the    |
| bus or even arrive home ahead of someone. It tells you that there is        |
| something more to the story than just simply walking towards a              |
| specific goal. The defining words “fast food” could indicate that a         |
| person didn’t have the time to cook or that they’re still hungry .          |

| Reading between the lines effectively often means looking at the            |
| whole picture. You watch out for the words, the tone, the facial            |
| expression, and the gestures a person makes in order to fully               |
| understand what they’re trying to tell beneath the surface. There will      |
| be times when the message is confusing as what a person says is             |
| opposite of what their body is saying.                                      |
| So how do you make the call? How do you decide betw een these               |
| two messages?                                                               |
| If you want to play it safe, then sticking to what a person is saying is    |
| almost always the better option. You listen to what they say and you        |
| interpret it without considering the subtle body language that              |
| indicates the opposite. However , if you’re confident of your reading       |
| and know the person fairly well to take that leap of chance, then do        |
| so! Just keep in mind that your actions have consequences, not just         |
| with yourself but with this other person.                                   |
| Follow Where the Line Leads                                                 |
| You’ll also notice that many people ask seemingly polite questions          |
| that actually lead them to the information they actually want. This is      |
| fairly common in first dates when you want to find out about sensitive      |
| information through seemingly simple questions.                             |
| Here are the typical statements that, when combined with tone and           |
| body language, can mean completely dif ferent things:                       |
| “I don’t kiss up to anybody” – I don’t care what people                     |
| think, I’m going to say what I want to say .                                |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 81 =====                                                         |
| “I don’t care what anyone thinks” – I’m really insecure and                 |
| worry about what other people might think of me.                            |
| “It’s not you, it’ s me” – It’ s actually you that is the problem.          |
| “I have to learn for myself” – I want to be independent or I                |
| don’t want you to see me be stupid.                                         |
| “I’m just crazy like that” – I have no idea what I’m doing                  |
| and I want people to find it amusing.                                       |
| “What do you do for a living?” – Usually , this is a polite way             |
| of asking a person how much money they’re making. This                      |
| is a need that connects with socio-economic security .                      |
| “We need to talk about our relationship” – This can be a                    |
| dangerous thing when said by a woman. Usually , this                        |
| statement is said when a woman wants to reassess a                          |
| relationship or tell her partner everything she thinks is                   |
| being badly done in the relationship.                                       |
| “Deep down, he’s a good person” – Everything this person                    |
| has been doing so far indicates he’ s a bad person.                         |
| “Do I look fat in this?” – I know I look fat, but I want you to             |
| tell me otherwise.                                                          |
| “I’m always honest, if you don’t like the truth then don’t ask              |
| me” – I don’t care if what I say will hurt your feelings, I’m               |
| going to say it anyway                                                      |
| “Fine, let’s talk” – If this come s from a man, this is usually a           |
| sign of resigna tion. They’re willing to talk, but they’re not              |
| going to be happy about it.                                                 |
| “Do you think she’s pretty?” – If this comes from a woman ,                 |
| this can be her asking if you’re too stupid to admit that you               |
| find someone else prettier than her .                                       |
| “It’s really nice meeting you” – I probably won’t remembe r                 |
| your name later .                                                           |
| “Nothing” – If this comes from a woman, this can be                         |
| indicative of anger or frustration.                                         |
| I want you to remember that these interpretations aren’t 100%               |
| accurate. The translations vary depending on the situation and the          |
| person you’re talking to.                                                   |
|                                                                             |

| Chapter 10: The Art of Thin Slicing                                         |
| Time and again, I talked about the importance of practice and               |
| experience in this book. I placed emphasis on the fact that you need        |
| to know a person or at the very least, be able to establish a baseline      |
| before making readings or arriving at conclusions about a specific          |
| individual.                                                                 |
| You’re probably asking: but what if I don’t know the person for a long      |
| time? What if I never have the chance to actually know them? I have         |
| to be honest, so far in this book, I still haven’t discussed the            |
| possibility of “speed reading” people through non-verbal                    |
| communication. There will be instances when you don’t have the              |
| luxury of time. You will need to make a snap second decision on a           |
| particular situa tion based only on non-verbal cues. What do you do         |
| then?                                                                       |
| Let me introduce to you the concept of thin-slicing.                        |
| This is a concept that’s been talked about by various authors,              |
| including best-selling writer , Malcolm Gladwell in his book: Blink.        |
| What Is Thin Slicing?                                                       |
| Thin-slicing is a “reading” technique that needs only a short span of       |
| time for reading. It’s actually a term used in psychology which             |
| describes a person’ s ability to find patterns and make conclusions         |
| based only on very small factors or narrow windows of exposure—             |
| hence the thin slices. The beauty here is that even with such thinly        |
| sliced information; you can still get accurate results as if you’ve         |
| observed this person for a long period of time.                             |
| How Thin-Slicing Translates to Day-to-Day Life                              |
| In Malcolm Gladwell’ s book Blink , he talks about how art                  |
| connoisseurs often know when a particular work of art is the real           |
| thing or just the copy of an original. In that split second that they see   |
| something, even before all the scientific tests are done, they can say      |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 83 =====                                                         |
| when a work does not deserve all the accolades given to it. A good          |
| example would be the Getty Kouros which was sold for 10 million             |
| dollars and was verified by scientists to be from around 530 B.C.           |
| However , many art scholars look at it and see a modern forgery ,           |
| which means that it’s not worth the 10 million dollars that was used        |
| to buy it.                                                                  |
| This split-second ability of art scholars to identify what’ s fake and      |
| what’ s not is the very context of thin-slicing. Believe it or not, we also |
| do this in day-to-day life, you just might not realize it yet. Here are     |
| some situations when thin-slicing has been proven to be ef fective.         |
| First Impression                                                            |
| Have you ever listened to a lecture for five minutes and could              |
| instantly tell if the lecturer is a good one or not? Studies show that      |
| students listening to a five-minute lecture are capable of judging          |
| whether a professor is good or not, in the same way as a student            |
| who has had that same professor for the whole semeste r. It seems           |
| that first impressions can be just as accurate, before any sort of          |
| assessment or ideas float into your head that interfere with this thin-     |
| slice. One interesting thing, however , is that women seem to have          |
| better thin-slicing capabilities compared to men.                           |
| Speed Dating                                                                |
| Funny enough, thin-slicing is also used in speed dating situations to       |
| help single individuals find life partners. In fact, even that simple 15-   |
| minute interaction with a person is more than enough time for men           |
| and women to decide on whether they’d want to meet someone for a            |
| second date or not. Another interesting thing to note though is that        |
| female speed daters tend to focus on the negative characteristics of        |
| men and are generally more critical of the men in the lineup. On the        |
| flipside, men are more open-minded in speed dating and seem to              |
| have lower standards in these instances. In any case, if you find           |
| yourself doubtful of doing speed dating, then you should know that          |
| there’ s actually enough evidence to back up this method of finding a       |
| life partner .                                                              |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 84 =====                                                         |
| Social Media Profiles                                                       |
| If you’re not big on face-to-f ace meet-ups, then you can check out         |
| Tinder , which is a social media app that also allows you to technically    |
| go on a speed date. Really , when it comes right down to it, there’ s no    |
| other platform better than social media profiles to practice your thin-     |
| slicing capabili ties. Just by going through a person’ s newsfeed, you      |
| can immediately tell what kind of person they are, the things they          |
| like, their hobbies, job, and the social culture they surround              |
| themselves with.                                                            |
| This isn’t really surprising since social media profiles present the        |
| many sides of an individual in one convenient package, allowing             |
| visitors to have a fairly good judgment on who they’re talking to. This     |
| has a big impa ct in the dating scene, especially if you have a Tinder      |
| profile. Another import impact this has on your life is through job         |
| searches. Nowadays, potential employers take a good look at                 |
| profiles of potential employe es and make judgment calls on what            |
| they see on the newsfeed.                                                   |
| Sexual Preferences                                                          |
| Another interesting aspect of life where thin-slicing seems to be           |
| practiced is in sexual preferences. A study conducted in 1999               |
| showed that people can actually perceive a person’ s sexual                 |
| orientation accurately . Based only on silent videos spanning 10            |
| seconds, people had an accuracy rate of 70% when perceiving a               |
| person’ s gender preference or sexual orientation. Perhaps not so           |
| surprising is that homosexuals are more accurate in perceiving              |
| sexual preferences than heterosexuals. Perhaps there’ s such a thing        |
| as “gaydar” after all!                                                      |
| Personality Disorder                                                        |
| Have you ever looked at someone and felt like something is “of f” with      |
| them? It turns out that personality disorders are something people          |
| can perceive through thin-slicing. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly what       |
| lets you know when someo ne is a tad off, but most people who               |
| notice it often react accordingly by limiting their interaction with that   |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 85 =====                                                         |
| particular person—or perhaps paying more attention, depending on            |
| what they want to achieve.                                                  |
| Detecting Lies                                                              |
| Okay , so I just dedicated a whole chapter to this so it doesn’t really     |
| bear repeating. Let’s just say that most people have a gut feeling          |
| when they’re being lied to. Perhaps one of the most powerful                |
| examples of thin-slicing lies is when it comes to relationships.            |
| Women often talk about how they just “feel” that their husband or           |
| significant other is cheating on them. A study conducted by the             |
| University of Texas at El Paso once tested the theory of thin-slicing       |
| by asking one group to provide a verbal rationale for why they did          |
| something.                                                                  |
| It turns out that the group asked to rationalize their decisions            |
| performed more poorly than the group asked to just make their               |
| decisions instantaneously and upon gut instinct. What does this tell        |
| us? That when confronted with rationalized thinking, gut instincts or       |
| thin slices can be easily sway by logic. Is this a bad thing or a good      |
| thing? It depends on the context and in all honesty , this book cannot      |
| tell you about which decision would be better .                             |
| Parent Interactions                                                         |
| One interesting aspect where thin-slicing becomes prominent is the          |
| interaction of parents with their children. According to research, a        |
| parent’ s tone of voice when addressing a normal child and one with         |
| a behav ioral problem have a slight variation that’s obvious enough to      |
| be noted by teachers. This is crucial in educational settings as            |
| teachers meet parents on the first day of class. By simply watching         |
| that parent-chi ld interaction, teachers can already tell if they have to   |
| pay more atten tion to the child for behavioral issues, or if they can      |
| relax knowing that the child will behave. Surprisingly enough, the          |
| same seems to hold true. Simply through teach er-student                    |
| interaction, observers can tell which teachers are biased and which         |
| ones have unrealistic expectations over their charges.                      |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 86 =====                                                         |
| What’s in Thin-Slicing?                                                     |
| Here’ s a question: what’ s the element we’re looking at when it comes      |
| to thin slicing? Yes, we’re looking at a small portion of information to    |
| judge a whole, but what information are we really looking at? For           |
| example, when speed dating, what particular factor do women look            |
| at in deciding that they want to see a man again or not? What is the        |
| heaviest element that decides the case?                                     |
| As much as I want to answer this question, the fact is that it varies       |
| from one situation to the next. In an effort to answer this question,       |
| however , let me give you an example.                                       |
| In Malcom Gladwell’ s book, he talked about thin-slicing marriages.         |
| Within second s of seeing a couple, one can instantly tell if it will       |
| result in a divorce or not. But what exactly does one look at to            |
| determine the length of a marriage?                                         |
| Accordingly , this one element is: contempt. Marriages that seem to         |
| be doomed to fail involve those where one partner seems to be               |
| contemptuous of another . This means that one in a couple feels             |
| superior over the other and interacts with them in a way that makes         |
| the other person feel less of a person. Contempt can be seen                |
| through some of the interactions between these couples, which               |
| leads to a conclusion that they’re not bound to last.                       |
| So is this true for all thin-slices? Can you just focus on ONE element      |
| and already make an accur ate prediction of a specific situation?           |
| Studies show that you can, but again, the accuracy is not as reliable       |
| as when you rely on big slices of information.                              |
| So How Do I Do This Thin-Slicing?                                           |
| The question now is this: are you in the position to thin-slice? What       |
| skills do you have to master in order to be able to do this?                |
| The good news is that thin-slicing is something that you innately           |
| have. I’m pretty sure that you’ve made decisions based on “instinct”        |
| before and this is largely what thin-slicing is all about. You make         |
| decisions based on very little information that you’ve gathered             |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 87 =====                                                         |
| combined with a gut feeling that compels you to follow a specific           |
| direction.                                                                  |
| But how should you correla te this with the previous chapters that          |
| encourage you to study , listen, and observe as much as you can             |
| before making a decision? Well, I want to remind you that there are         |
| instances when you have the luxury of studying an individ ual. If you       |
| have this optio n and could take the time to make your decision, then       |
| take it! If your time is limited, however , then thin-slicing would be an   |
| acceptable method, even if you might not be 100% comfortable                |
| about it.                                                                   |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 88 =====                                                         |
| Chapter 11: What About Me?                                                  |
| So far in this book, we talked about other people. Specifically , about     |
| the dif ferent personality types, how to identify a personality type, how   |
| to read body language, and so on. Really , the only thing we haven’t        |
| talked about is: you. When it comes right down to it, YOU are the           |
| most important part of the equation.                                        |
| Why is this? I’d like to remind you that this book’ s ultimate goal is to   |
| help you connect with people, and not all connections are equal. The        |
| way you connect with a work friend is very different from the way you       |
| connect with a school friend or a neighbor . Would you tell a work          |
| friend in-depth information about yourself in the same way you’d tell       |
| a high school friend or your best friend? Of course not!                    |
| Of course, that’s not the only factor at play here. The way you             |
| communicate is also dictated by the kind of person you are. All the         |
| personality types and traits we discussed in a previous chapter all         |
| apply to you too! Hence, you have to figure out if you’re an introvert      |
| or extrovert, an intuitive or a sensor , a thinker or a feeler , and a      |
| perceiver or judger .                                                       |
| Why is this important? Well, your ability to connect with people is         |
| limited by your own personality . For example, if you’re an extrovert,      |
| how are you supposed to connect with someone who is an introvert?           |
| If you’re a feeler , how do you make connections with someone who           |
| is a sensor? This is why I strongly encourage you to take the test          |
| and learn as much about yourself as possible. This is crucial               |
| because if you really want to make that connection, you might find          |
| yourself in situations that you’re uncomfortable in. For example,           |
| extroverts form connections even when they spend time in large              |
| groups. Introverts, however , prefer quiet one-on-one interactions.         |
| So what happ ens now? The goal of this chapter is to introduce a            |
| comfortable medium between two opposing personality types. I don’t          |
| want you to think this means that there are personality types that will     |
| never be compatible with each other . The great thing about working         |
| with people is that they have the capacity to adapt. Given the right        |
| incentive, you can adjust to accommodate other people and vice              |
| versa.                                                                      |
|                                                                             |

| Here are some of the actions you need to keep in mind:                      |
| Negative Body Language                                                      |
| ● Arms folded in front of the body                                          |
| ● Tense or minimal facial expression                                        |
| ● Body turned away from another person                                      |
| ● Downcast eyes                                                             |
| ● No eye contact                                                            |
| Disengagement Body Language                                                 |
| ● Bad sitting posture                                                       |
| ● Writing or doodling                                                       |
| ● Gazing or staring of f into space                                         |
| ● Downcast head                                                             |
| ● Fidgeting or fiddling with some items                                     |
| Positive Body Language                                                      |
| Have an open posture. Keep the muscles relaxed without slouching            |
| on the chair . Keep your body upright and hands placed on the side          |
| or comfortably folded in front of you. This will give the appearance of     |
| being open to the conversation, engagement, and willingness to              |
| listen to what the other person has to say .                                |
| Avoid touching your face when talking to another person. While it’s         |
| not necessarily true, most people view face touching as a sign of           |
| dishonesty . For example, there are people who touch or scratch their       |
| nose when answering a question. When this happens, the other                |
| person often views this action as dishonesty on the part of the other       |
| person. Again, this isn’t technically true, but you don’t have control      |
| on how other people think. Hence, try to avoid doing this when              |
| you’re trying to make a good impression during a conversation.              |
| Maintain eye contact. Maintaining another person’ s gaze during a           |
| conversation is a sign of engagement, interest, and sincerity . It’s a      |
| good way of communicating your interest without saying a word. In           |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 90 =====                                                         |
| certain instanc es, it can be an excellent way to silently encourage        |
| someone in doing a performance, a presentation, or some other               |
| activity .                                                                  |
| Use a firm handshake. Firm doesn’t necessarily mean painful—it’ s           |
| simply a firm grip that helps communicate your sincerity and                |
| resolution in the meeting. It’s often seen as a way of showing the          |
| other person that you have a strong personality and are willing to          |
| back up your decisions in the conversation. During job interviews or        |
| meeting a potential client, it’s an excellent non-verbal way to assure      |
| them of your trustworthiness. Play this carefully; a too-tight grip will    |
| make you seem aggressive while a limp one will make you seem                |
| weak and easily controlled.                                                 |
| Body Language During Public Speaking                                        |
| Remember , it’s not enough that you can read other people’ s body           |
| language, it’s also important that you can evoke the right emotion          |
| you want through your own body language. Knowing how to position            |
| and move your body is crucial in many situations, but none as               |
| important as when you’re speaking in public.                                |
| Here are some tips to keep in mind when public speaking:                    |
| Maintain a positive posture. Stand or sit upright with your shoulders       |
| and arms at your sides. You can fold your hands in front of you or          |
| keep them relaxed at your sides. Obviously , if you’re engaging in          |
| public speakin g, then you will be using those hands to emphasize           |
| what you’re trying to say through gestures. Whatever you do, do             |
| NOT slouch or put those hands in your pockets, as this would make           |
| you look like you’re not really interested in the situation.                |
| Practice your posture in front of the mirror if necessary . You practice    |
| what you’re supposed to say in your presentation, so why not include        |
| the way you actually do that presentation? The goal here is to make         |
| yourself look competent without being aggressive or arrogant. Keep          |
| your head up but keep a slight tilt to your mouth to maintain a             |
| positive façade.                                                            |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 91 =====                                                         |
| Make use of open hand gestures. We already talked about this.               |
| Open hand gestures invite the audience to listen and give of f positive     |
| vibes. If you can’t keep your hands relaxed at your sides, then             |
| position them so that the upper arms are close to your body and the         |
| palms are facing up. This communicates a willingness to                     |
| communicate on a deeper level.                                              |
| There will be instances when your audience might be slipping off or         |
| no longer listening to what you’re saying. If this seems to be              |
| happening, you can try leaning slightly forward while speaking. This        |
| subtle move lets the audienc e think that you’re taking them into your      |
| confidence. It’s the same gesture people make when they’re trying to        |
| tell a secret, making you feel as though you’re part of the group. This     |
| gesture instantly gains the attention of people and allows you to           |
| keep them present.                                                          |
| Don’t Forget the Golden Rule!                                               |
| Remember , the whole point of this book is to help you connect with         |
| people, so I need you to understand that the Golden Rule still              |
| applies here. What’ s that? It simply states: Do not do unto others         |
| what you don’t want others to do unto you. Hence, if you want to            |
| connect with people and forge stronger relationships with them,             |
| you’ll have to keep their wants and needs in mind. If you find yourself     |
| getting mixed signals or unsure about how to go forwar d, just ask          |
| yourself, Would I want this for me? If you don’t want the same thing        |
| to be done to you, then it makes sense that others don’t want it to be      |
| done to them too!                                                           |
| Body Language During Interviews                                             |
| Interviews are also an excelle nt time to practice your body language       |
| reading skills and, more importantly , your skills in responding            |
| correctly to the body langua ge you’ve read. During interviews, you         |
| want to create a positive impression on your interviewer in order to        |
| get the results you want, such as getting hired for a job or getting        |
| their approval over something. Here are some tips that should help          |
| create a positive experience through body language:                         |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 92 =====                                                         |
| Use mirroring. You’ve probably heard about this often, which is only        |
| normal becaus e it really works. Mirroring is a technique where you         |
| subtly mirror or copy the body language of the person you’re talking        |
| to. This has the effect of building rapport as mirroring makes it look      |
| like the two of you are on the same page. Note though, mirroring is a       |
| fairly well known technique nowadays so there’ s a chance the               |
| interviewer also knows you’re doing it. Hence, it’s important not to        |
| copy every single gesture they make as this will have the opposite          |
| effect.                                                                     |
| Put emphasis on the gesture s that show interest. Do not overdo it,         |
| but make a point of nodding, smiling, and keeping your body relaxed         |
| during an interview . The technique of slightly leaning in towards your     |
| interviewer can also work here, allowing you to create the illusion of      |
| rapport.                                                                    |
| When asked a difficult question, don’t be afraid to pause and think         |
| about what you’re going to say first. Touch your cheek, gaze off a          |
| little, or bite your lips. This will show the interviewer that you’re       |
| reflecting on your answer or putting the proper amount of thought           |
| into it.                                                                    |
| Obviously , do NOT show any negative body postures such as                  |
| slouching or resting your chin on your hands in what seems to be a          |
| bored position. Don’t make any unnecessary gestures such as                 |
| tapping your hands or feet. These are signs of boredom or                   |
| disinterest and will give a negative impression.                            |
| What is my personality type?                                                |
| Another questi on you should explore about yourself would be your           |
| own personality type based on the MBIT descriptions we’ve given in          |
| the past chapters. I want you to be aware of your own strengths and         |
| shortcomings when it comes to connecting and communicating with             |
| people. You might be an introvert trying to connect with an extrovert,      |
| which makes the job doubly hard for you. Perhaps the situation is           |
| vice versa. Hence, your ability is limited by your own means and by         |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 93 =====                                                         |
| realizing your personality type, you should be able to make headway         |
| and figure out what factors are holding you from reaching your goals.       |
| What is my communication style?                                             |
| Now, we have to talk about the kind of communicator you happen to           |
| be. You migh t not realize it, but you have a specific way of               |
| communicating and so do other people. The goal is to adjust your            |
| communication style slightly so that you can easily connect with            |
| others through verbal and non-verbal means.                                 |
| Here are the typical communication styles today . Keep in mind that         |
| these communication styles apply to others as well as to you:               |

| The analytical communicator makes good use of data and real                 |
| numbers. If this is you, then you like to use references when               |
| establishing your point. For example, you say, “Twenty percent of           |
| people in the financial industry are male” or some such other               |
| number . When a person says “a large number of workers in the               |
| financial industry are male,” you’re likely to say: what does “large        |
| number” mean exactly? Hence, these are the kind of people who feel          |
| impatient or intolerant of conversations centered on feelings and           |
| emotions. If this is you, then this is probably your biggest drawback       |
| as you are likely to become silent during emotional conversations,          |
| having problems saying what you think or feel into words.                   |
| The advantage is obvious—a nalytical communicators are very good            |
| when it comes to logical conversations. They think before they talk         |
| and do not like chatty and shallow conversations.                           |
| If you prefer this type of communication, keep in mind that you may         |
| sound completely cold or unfeeling. People are going to feel unsure         |
| about making emotional gestures towards you because they think              |
| you’re going to react badly to them. You have to learn how to be a bit      |
| softer or open up to others in order to encourage discourse.                |
| Intuitive                                                                   |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 94 =====                                                         |
| Intuitive communicators are the kinds who likes to see the big              |
| picture. They start with the general rule and then whittle it down to       |
| the basics. They are really not fond of the details but prefer a big        |
| view or a bird’s eye view of what’ s going on. If you are an intuitive      |
| type, then chances are you go from A to Z in one quick burst. For           |
| example, you’re confronted with a situation and instantly have a            |
| conclusion without itemizing the different points you went through to       |
| get there. Intuitive communicators can be frustrating for functional        |
| communicators as they like to itemize the steps, making sure that           |
| each letter has been thoroughly explained before arriving at Z.             |
| So what adjustment should you make as an intuitive? First, you              |
| should make an effort toward s explaining your thought process. Give        |
| others the time to follow your idea, making sure that each point has        |
| been explained before arrivin g at the conclusion. Try to develop a bit     |
| more patience because not everyone prefers your quick method of             |
| communication. Who knows, you might even realize that you like the          |
| lively conversation that come s with this step-by-step approach to a        |
| subject.                                                                    |
| Functional                                                                  |
| As mentioned, functional communicators are the types who like to            |
| itemize steps from Point A to Point Z. They like the step-by-step           |
| fashion, making sure that nothing gets missed. In fact, they’re the         |
| ones who like to-do lists to make sure that everything is covered in        |
| their priorities. In order to adjust, you will have to recogn ize the big   |
| picture while at the same time, gently encouraging others to look into      |
| the various steps.                                                          |
| You know it’s important beca use the small steps can still fully impact     |
| the big picture , which means that even a small mistake can cause           |
| problems in its accomplishm ent. Because you are interested in the          |
| small details, the group will look towards you for the implementation.      |
| Your role is to keep everyone’ s eye on the goal while at the same          |
| time correlating it with the steps necessary for accomplishment. You        |
| might even find yourself playing devil’ s advocate becau se of your         |
| need to stick to the minuscule steps. Be prepared for a bit of              |
| resistance, but understand that what you’re doing is important.             |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 95 =====                                                         |
| An important thing to remem ber as a functional communicator is to          |
| improve your skills in grabbing and maintaining the attention of your       |
| audience. The small details leading towards a bigger end can be             |
| quite taxing for people and they will quickly lose interest during a        |
| representation. Hence, you can make use of body language                    |
| techniques to encourage interest and guarantee that people are on           |
| the same page as you.                                                       |
| Personal Communicator                                                       |
| Finally , we have the personal communicator who prefers to dwell on         |
| the emotional aspect of things. You find it important to figure out not     |
| just what a person is thinking but also what they feel about a              |
| particular situation. Personal communicators are the kinds capable          |
| of smoothing out conflicts and ensuring that everyone feels                 |
| confident, happy , and satisfied in their chosen environment. You’re        |
| the glue that holds everyone together , often acting as the bridge          |
| towards different miscommunications. You can also pick up vibes in          |
| the room, having the natural ability to read the room and identify          |
| tension even before they occur .                                            |
| The downside of this is that personal communicators can be easily           |
| affected by the underlying emotional atmosphere. If overwhelmed,            |
| you might find yourself acting out instead of being the glue that           |
| keeps the group sane. Hence, as a personal communicator , your              |
| best adjustment would be to keep a rational and level head in order         |
| to keep everyone within acceptable ranges of communication.                 |
| One thing I want you to understand is that there is no “best”               |
| communication style. All these styles have a specific advantage,            |
| depending on the use. It’s therefore important to be flexible with your     |
| communication style so that you’ll be able to adjust to the situation.      |
| Remember , this is all about preferences so you might actually find         |
| yourself able to switch from one communication style to the next.           |
| The more you practice these techniques, the better you become in            |
| taking on any role that’ s needed in that particular situation.             |
|                                                                             |

| Chapter 12: More Body Language Tips and Myths                               |
| As we alread y mentioned, your ability to read the non-verbal               |
| communication of the people around you is one thing. Your ability to        |
| convey non-verbal mess ages on your own is another .                        |
| Communication takes two things: the initial message and the reply .         |
| Simply put, I want you to be good with non-verbal commu nication as         |
| well, not just with the initiatory message but also with the reply . At     |
| the very least, I want you to be able to use body language to your          |
| advantage.                                                                  |
| Here’ s a secre t though: studies show that how you move or the body        |
| posture you assume also contributes to how you feel. It is not just a       |
| one-way street.                                                             |
| What does this mean?                                                        |
| For example, if you feel sad or down, you tend to slouch your body .        |
| When people see you doing this, they can instantly tell that you feel       |
| sad or are depressed. Your posture is a non-verbal sign of what             |
| you’re feeling inside.                                                      |
| But the reverse actually holds true! This means that even if you feel       |
| bad but postur e your body in a way that conveys confidenc e, you will      |
| slowly gain confidence. It’s a mind over matter thing and it can help       |
| you through many problems in life.                                          |
| How do you do this? Here are some body language tips to help you            |
| convey the exact message you want to make in any situation:                 |
| If You Want to Feel Confident                                               |
| Ever seen the pose Superman makes? This is the “confidence” pose            |
| that could make you feel like you’re more confident than usual. This        |
| high-power pose stimulates testosterone levels and lowers the               |
| number of cortisol in the body . As you probably know , that cortisol is    |
| a stress hormone and the less of this in your body , the better it would    |
| be for you. What’ s the pose exactly? Hands on your hips, feet apart,       |
| and your shoulders stretched wide with the chest puffed out. Try not        |
| to overd o it too much so people don’t look at you weirdly . But this       |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 97 =====                                                         |
| should work perfectly and give you the confidence boost you need            |
| for the situation.                                                          |
| Of course, there are other confidence poses out there, verified by          |
| Harvard no less. It’s the high power pose of leaning back in your           |
| chair , hands on your head, and feet up on the desk. You’ve probably        |
| seen this being done by businessmen in movies when they want to             |
| show how cocky they are. As it turns out, it works perfectly in             |
| boosting morale and ego. Of course, you can’t do this while in a            |
| meeting, but if you’re tackling a hard problem at the office, assuming      |
| this pose for a few seconds should help.                                    |
| To Make People Participate, Look Like You Are                               |
| Actually Listening                                                          |
| This might seem like a no-bra iner, but a lot of people forget the value    |
| of listening when someone speaks. If you want to increase the               |
| participation in a meeting, verbal methods aren’t enough. You have          |
| to show people that you’re really listening to what they have to say.       |
| Look at people when they speak and nod along with them in order to          |
| create the sense of being listened to. Don’t doodle or tap on your          |
| phone or check the room to see what the others are doing. Instead,          |
| focus on the person speaking and establish eye contact. This will           |
| help encourage people into verbalizing their thoughts and create a          |
| more honest atmosphere for discourse.                                       |
| Shake Hands to Trigger a Connection                                         |
| Barring cultura l difference, shaking hands is considered one of the        |
| best ways to cultivate a connection with an individual. Touch is one        |
| of the most primitive nonverbal ways of communicatio n, as we               |
| already talked about in a previous chapter . Again, handshakes can          |
| communicate so much in just a short span of time. The length of the         |
| handshake, the firmness of the hands, and so on are all indicative of       |
| what a person thinks, feels, or who they are as individuals . In fact, a    |
| study shows that a good handshake can put a lasting impression on           |
| an individual, making a person remember you for a longer period.            |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 98 =====                                                         |
| This is why a good handshake is very important when it comes to             |
| applying for a job.                                                         |
| Smile to Promote Good Feelings                                              |
| A genuine smile stimulates not only your sense of well-being, it            |
| likewise tells those around that you’re cooperative, approachable,          |
| and trustworthy . A genuine smile comes on slowly , lights up the face,     |
| crinkles the eyes, and fades slowly away . Most importantly , smiling       |
| has a direct influence on how people respond to you. When you               |
| smile at somebody , they almost always would smile in return. And,          |
| since facial expressions elicit corresponding feelings, the smiles you      |
| get back actually change the person’ s emotional state positively .         |
| Encourage Collaboration by Removing Barriers                                |
| You have probably seen offices with an open layout. It’s supposed to        |
| encourage collaboration among people and improve creativity .               |
| Studies show that this type of open-layout setup in offices allows          |
| people to connect with each other quickly and improve the                   |
| camaraderie in the office. However , barriers aren’t just limited to        |
| walls. The fact is that people always create unintentional barriers in      |
| their day-to-day life. For example, you’re probably holding a book in       |
| such a way that it blocks the eyeline of a person you’re talking to.        |
| You might be holding a coffee cup in a way to discourage                    |
| conversation or perhaps clutching a coat so tightly that it                 |
| discourages people to talk to you. Be mindful of your gestures and          |
| how they come off to others and vice versa. If you want to promote          |
| communication with people, then an open line must start from you.           |
| Improve Your Speech with Your Hands                                         |
| Believe it or not, gesturing while you speak is actually helpful in         |
| explaining your position. Gesture is literally linked to speech in the      |
| brain, allowing your thought process to become faster and clearer as        |
| your hands move. This is why liars often have “late” hand gestures;         |
| this is because what they’re saying isn’t really deeply linked to their     |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 99 =====                                                         |
| mind. The hands don’t natura lly follow so they have to make up for it      |
| with delayed gestures.                                                      |
| Look at People’s Feet for Added Insight                                     |
| The feet are also a big deal when it comes to body language. Feet           |
| are tapped, played with, or pointed in different directions, depending      |
| on a person’ s mood. Perhaps one of the biggest indicator s is where        |
| the feet are pointed. If the foot is directed away from you during a        |
| conversation, then chances are that person doesn’t really want to           |
| talk. If it is pointed towards you, however , then they’re fully engaged    |
| in the conversa tion. Relative to other body parts, seeing the feet can     |
| also help with reading. In fact, studies show that people can read          |
| others more accurately if they can see the whole body .                     |
| Keep Your Voice Low for an Authoritative Sound                              |
| Let your voice relax before making an important call or speech. It          |
| appears that a low and steady voice actually communicates authority         |
| and power as opposed to a high one. Allow for a slight increase in          |
| the middle of a sentence and drop it down again so that it closely          |
| resembles words like “um, hum, um hum.” It’s a very subtle way of           |
| affecting the senses, relaxing other people and putting you in a            |
| position of power without trying too much.                                  |
| Common Body Language Myths Busted                                           |
| Also note that there are lots of body language tips out there that you      |
| want to watch out for. Many of these are myths or have been proven          |
| wrong by science and studies. Do not rely on these techniques and           |
| methods anymore as they won’t do much for you.                              |
| Staring at someone can intimidate them.                                     |
| It’s actually true that alpha males tend to blink less, but that doesn’t    |
| mean that staring at someone turns you into an alpha male. This             |
| technique borders on weird and alarming rather than a sign of               |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 100 =====                                                        |
| dominance in people. In many cases, this can only start a fight with        |
| other people.                                                               |
| Speaking first gives you the upper hand.                                    |
| This is not the case at all as nowadays, people look more into the          |
| context of things rather than who gets to speak first. The same goes        |
| for spea king louder or faster in a conversation. A flood of information    |
| will not defeat accuracy and clarity in debates or friendly arguments.      |
| Touch the person first to establish dominance.                              |
| Again, this is a lot like speaki ng first so you will have the upper hand.  |
| It doesn ’t really have a big impact in the conversation and will not       |
| predict who the alpha is in the situation. In fact, some advice says        |
| that you shou ld put your hand on top of the other during a                 |
| conversation, but this only adds unnecessary contact and actually           |
| borders on familiarity . In a business setting, it’s not really an ideal    |
| technique.                                                                  |
| I can’t stress this enough— body language is an inexact science.            |
| Mannerisms and behaviors vary so your baseline will change                  |
| depending on your mood and the other person’ s mood. When all               |
| else fails however , there is always one thing you can do in order to       |
| truly connect with a person: ask them honestly about what they think        |
| or feel. If you are lucky enough to be in the position to ask this          |
| question, then do so! The honest words of an individual will always         |
| trump what seems to be their silent messages through their bodies.          |
|                                                                             |

| C o n c l u s i o n                                                         |
| So here we are, at the end of this book! I’m happy you have made it         |
| this far and I hope you found all the information stated here useful for    |
| day-to-day life.                                                            |
| Again, I want you to remember that this book was made to help you           |
| forge a connection with people. Please don’t use your newfound              |
| powers for evil!                                                            |
| In this book, we’ve covered the following important topics:                 |
| ● Explanations on body language and how it can help you                     |
| decipher what people really think or feel in particular situa tions.        |
| More importantly , we covered how you can use this information              |
| to communicate better with people.                                          |
| ● I’ve given you information on the various body language                   |
| people use and what they mean.                                              |
| ● I also talked about the dif ferent personality types and how their        |
| unique makeup makes them act uniquely in different                          |
| circumstances.                                                              |
| ● I also tackled different communication styles and how to                  |
| understand the motivations of people in order to figure out what            |
| they really want to do.                                                     |
| ● I’ve also introduced the concept of thin-slicing and how you              |
| can learn more about yourself in order to strengthen your                   |
| societal bonds.                                                             |
| By now, I hope you’re satisfie d that I covered all the promises I made     |
| in the beginning of this book. I understand if things are a little bit      |
| confusing even at this stage—it’ s supposed to be. The fact is that         |
| understanding people is a lifetime process so you will find the need        |
| to constantly evaluate your baselines as you move forward.                  |
| ere’s one thing I want you to remember when using this book: you            |
| only have control over your own values, actions, and reactions. It          |
| doesn’t matter how badly you want to connect or forge ties with             |
| someone—you cannot make people like you if their values are                 |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 102 =====                                                        |
| intrinsically different from yourself. Keep in mind that connection is      |
| based on similarities and there’ s no point connecting with someone         |
| when nothing is similar between the two of you. Remember: you               |
| matter first. Your values are personal to you and you should NOT            |
| allow other people to predict your values.                                  |
| So what do you do now? Here’ s what I want you to do:                       |
| 1. I want you to take a good look at yourself and assess your               |
| own values, personality , communication style, goals, and                   |
| everything else that pertains to you. I want you to deeply                  |
| get to know yourself first before attempting to know others.                |
| 2. Your next step would be to observe yourself. What are your               |
| mannerisms, your behavior , your tendencies when                            |
| confronted with specific situations? I want you to know                     |
| exactly what you’re doing wrong and what you’re doing                       |
| right.                                                                      |
| 3. Next is cultivating a system of thinking, analyzing, and                 |
| discovering your own values and motivations befor e                         |
| pursuing a behavior . Even before you do something, I want                  |
| you to pause and think about why you’re doing it. What’ s                   |
| your ultimate goal and what’ s the motivation behind it? Feel               |
| free to use Maslow’ s Hierarchy of Needs for this to help                   |
| you further narrow down your own motivations.                               |
| 4. Once you’ve figured out your goals and motivations, I want               |
| you to take a good look at the actions you propose to take.                 |
| Are those actions in line with your goals and motivations?                  |
| Will they achieve the results you want? What other roads                    |
| are there for you to take in order to get the same results,                 |
| but with much less hindrance on your part?                                  |
| 5. I encourage you to practice these four steps consistently in             |
| order to get to know yourself better and deeper throug h                    |
| personal analysis. Only after you’re comfortabl e                           |
| understanding yourself can you feel comfortable in                          |
| understanding others. One thing I want you to remember                      |
| though: you don’t have to understand yourself 100%! Face                    |
| it, peop le are a mystery and sometimes, we can be a                        |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 103 =====                                                        |
| mystery to ourselves too. All I encourage you to do is to try               |
| as often and as hard as you can to trace your motivations                   |
| before pursuing any sort of significant action.                             |
| So let’s say you’re comfortable understanding your own motivations          |
| at this point… what about other people? Here’ s what I want you to          |
| do:                                                                         |
| a) First, I discour age you against reading too much into people            |
| you don’t know or barely know. While thin-slicing is highly                 |
| effective, you should not use this as a way to figure out                   |
| everything around you. People-watching can be fun and a good                |
| way to hone your skills, but don’t take things too seriously .              |
| b) Start by focusing only on a small group of people. Make                  |
| decisions based on conscious “reading” efforts, but keep it                 |
| simple or in situations wher e getting it wrong wouldn’t have               |
| negative consequences in your life. Remember , you’re testing               |
| the waters here and just honing your skills.                                |
| c) I want you to always keep in mind that this book was written             |
| to help you CONNECT with people through developed verbal                    |
| and non-verbal skills. Hence, try not to use your new                       |
| superpowers for evil and keep connections in mind when trying               |
| to decipher people.                                                         |
| d) Have a pattern when observing people. This means having a                |
| fairly good idea of where to start when attempting to                       |
| understand them. For examp le, you look at the feet first, then             |
| the hands, then face, or any other sequence you may choose.                 |
| Having this pre-set programm ing on where to look gives you a               |
| story-type reading experience that can help with any                        |
| conclusions you might have about the situation. The beauty                  |
| here is that as you practice this technique, it becomes second              |
| nature to the point where you don’t even have to consci ously               |
| guide yourself through the process. Your mind instantly goes to             |
| these body parts in order to interpret what they mean.                      |
| e) Learn the art of listening and try not to be too self-absorbed.          |
| Even as an extrovert, you should be able to recognize the                   |
| enjoyment of being able to sit back in one corner of the room               |
|                                                                             |
| ===== Page 104 =====                                                        |
| and just take in the different movements and reactions of                   |
| people as they interact with each other .                                   |
| f) If you find things too difficult, I suggest you watch a movie            |
| multiple times and pay attention not just to the words but also to          |
| the actions and movements of the actors. Actors are trained in              |
| the proper action and reaction in dif ferent situations. Their facial       |
| expressions and even the slightest movement of the hands can                |
| convey so much and can help hone your skills in predictio n. It’s           |
| by far the safest way of approaching body language                          |
| understanding while enjoying yourself in the process. Make                  |
| sure to watch movies with very good actors known for their                  |
| excellent skills in the art. Meryl Streep movies are perhaps one            |
| of the best to do this, focus ing primarily on the movement of              |
| this amazing actress.                                                       |
| g) The beauty of watching movi es is that there’ s a way for you to         |
| confirm what you suspect about a certain situation. You can                 |
| look at a perso n’s expression in one scene and guess on what               |
| they think or feel. In a later scene, these emotions are often              |
| expressed out loud or given further focus, therefore allowing               |
| you to really figure out if what you initially thought was correct.         |
| h) When reading people in the real world, observe and keep your             |
| conclusions to yourself. Do not go around telling people that               |
| you’ve “read” how a particular coworker acts and make                       |
| expressive predictions because of it. I want you to keep any                |
| conclusions or ideas you have close to your heart and only use              |
| them when needed.                                                           |
| i) Practice, practice, practice! The beauty of reading body                 |
| language is that you never run out of people to observe or body             |
| language to read. There’ s always an endless supply of them,                |
| so feel free to practice as often as you want. Note though that             |
| acting on those observations isn’t always advisable. Think                  |
| about it multiple times before actually making a decision.                  |
| Yes—you are capable of reading people and making connections                |
| simply by honing your verbal and non-verbal skills! But it takes time,      |
| patience, and drive. It might seem like such a big project at first, but    |
| don’t let this stop you! Unless you live under a rock, forging              |
|                                                                             |

| connections and communicating with others is an integ ral part of           |
| your life. You will find that by mastering this talent, you too can         |
| achieve a kind of success that only few can boast about.                    |
|                                                                             |
